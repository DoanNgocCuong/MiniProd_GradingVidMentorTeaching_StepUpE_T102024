I have reviewed the files you uploaded. Here's a summary of their main functions:

1. **`funct_extendTranscriptionSegment.js`**: This script is designed to extend a segment of a transcription by a specified time range (default 120 seconds). It extracts start and end times from a JSON object and filters the transcription to get the relevant portion for the extended range【8†source】.

2. **`funct_getOpenAIResponse.js`**: This script sends a request to the OpenAI API and processes the response. It constructs a request payload based on system and user input prompts and includes error handling for API request failures【9†source】.

3. **`utilsReadWriteData.js`**: This file contains utility functions to read and write data to and from Google Sheets, including functions to get data from a specific sheet, write data, and copy data between sheets【10†source】.

4. **`config.js`**: This file defines the configuration for API keys, sheet names, and relevant ranges in Google Sheets. It organizes the data structure for different sheet sections and the OpenAI API parameters. It also includes constant values like the default time extension and sheet names【11†source】.

Do you have specific questions or modifications you would like to make to these scripts?

I have reviewed the additional files you uploaded. Here's a summary of the newly uploaded scripts:

1. **`miniRunDetectWarmLeadWrap.js`**: This script reads data from Google Sheets, uses the OpenAI API to detect segments (like warm-up, lead-in, etc.), and then writes the results back to a sheet. It uses system and user prompts from specific sheet ranges defined in the `CONFIG` file【20†source】.

2. **`miniRunExtendWarmUp.js`**: This script handles the extension of transcription for the warm-up segment. It fetches transcription and section data from the backend sheet, parses it into JSON, and extends the transcription based on a key (in this case, "warm_up"). It writes the extended transcription result back to the sheet【21†source】.

3. **`miniRunSugScoringWarmLeadWrap.js`**: This script processes the scoring for the warm-up, lead-in, and wrap-up sections. It retrieves the necessary prompts and data from Google Sheets, sends them to the OpenAI API, and writes the responses back into the sheets【22†source】.

4. **`miniRunDetectSugScoringWarmLeadWrap.js`**: This script integrates multiple functionalities. It runs detection, extension, and scoring for warm-up, lead-in, and wrap-up sections. After processing, it copies the detected JSON data and suggested scoring data to the output sheets for further use【23†source】.

Do you need help with specific functionality in these scripts or have any modifications in mind?

I have reviewed the additional files you uploaded. Here's a summary of the new scripts:

1. **`runDetectAll.js`**: This script performs detection for warm-up, vocabulary/pronunciation/grammar, and ICQs/CCQs sections. It sends requests to the OpenAI API and writes the detected information back into the Google Sheets【32†source】.

2. **`runExtendAll.js`**: This script handles extending transcription for multiple segments, including warm-up, vocabulary/pronunciation/grammar, and ICQs/CCQs. It uses predefined keys to apply the time extension and writes the results back into the sheets【33†source】.

3. **`runSugScoringAll.js`**: This script processes the suggested scoring for multiple segments (warm-up, vocabulary/pronunciation/grammar, ICQs/CCQs). It fetches relevant prompts and user input, communicates with the OpenAI API, and writes the results into the sheets【34†source】.

4. **`runAllBackendAndCopyToOutput.js`**: This script integrates all backend operations, running detection, transcription extension, and scoring. After processing, it copies the results from the backend sheet to the output sheet【35†source】.

These scripts seem to be part of a larger workflow to process transcriptions, extend segments, and generate scoring suggestions using OpenAI. Let me know if you'd like assistance with specific functionality or adjustments.

# README: Overview of Functions and Relationships

## 1. Overview

This project contains a series of scripts that perform various tasks such as detecting, extending, and scoring transcription segments using data from Google Sheets and processing via OpenAI API. The flow includes:

- **Detection** of transcription segments like "warm-up," "lead-in," and "wrap-up."
- **Extension** of those segments by a configurable time range.
- **Suggested Scoring** for each of the segments based on the model's response.

The scripts read input data from Google Sheets, send API requests to OpenAI, and write the results back to the sheets. 

## 2. Script Functions and Their Relationships


### 2.1 `config.js`

**Purpose**: Configuration file for managing API keys, sheet names, and predefined ranges.

- Defines constants for sheet names, cell ranges, API keys, and default time extensions.
  
**Relationships**:
- Used across all scripts to fetch system prompts, output locations, and API configuration details.



### 2.2 `funct_getOpenAIResponse.js`

**Purpose**: Sends a request to the OpenAI API and handles the response.

- **Main Function**:
  - `getOpenAIResponse(systemPrompt, userInputPrompt, apiKey)`
    - Sends a payload to OpenAI API with the specified system and user prompts and returns the model’s response.

**Relationships**:
- Used in multiple scripts, including detection (`runDetectAll.js`), scoring (`runSugScoringAll.js`), and warm-up segment analysis (`miniRunSugScoringWarmLeadWrap.js`).

### 2.3 `utilsReadWriteData.js`

- **Main Functions**:
  - `getDataFromSheet(sheetName, cellAddress)` – Fetches data from a specified sheet and cell.
  - `writeResponseToSheet(sheetName, range, result)` – Writes data to a specified sheet and cell range.
  - `copyDataBetweenSheets(sourceSheetName, sourceCell, targetSheetName, targetCell)` – Copies data from one sheet and cell to another.

**Relationships**:
- Provides core functionality for reading input data and writing results in almost all scripts.

### 2.4 `funct_extendTranscriptionSegment.js`
