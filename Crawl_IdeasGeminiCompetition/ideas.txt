Our project targets smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, who often face significant challenges due to crop diseases, unpredictable weather patterns, and limited access to reliable farming information. These farmers frequently suffer severe yield losses—sometimes as high as 100%—due to undiagnosed crop diseases, lack of timely weather updates, and outdated farming practices. These difficulties directly threaten their livelihoods and contribute to food insecurity in their communities.

Our solution is a cutting-edge platform powered by AI and the Gemini framework, designed to provide farmers with real-time, actionable insights. By allowing farmers to upload photos of their crops, the platform can instantly detect diseases, offering accurate diagnoses that help prevent devastating yield losses. The platform also delivers localized weather forecasts, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about planting and harvesting times. Additionally, it provides personalized farming tips tailored to each user's specific needs and regional conditions.

This solution directly addresses the challenges faced by smallholder farmers, leading to increased crop yields, improved food security, and greater economic stability. By empowering farmers with the tools and knowledge they need, our platform fosters sustainable agricultural practices, ultimately bringing about positive change in their lives and contributing to the broader goal of reducing poverty and hunger.

In addition to that, this website uses Gemini API for stock suggestions. User selects from a set of options, including: economic sector, dividend payment, blue-chip company (yes/no), and whether or not the company is taking actions to address climate change. Gemini AI is asked to find a publicly traded company that fits those criteria.

This website also uses Gemini API to evaluate investors' stock portfolios. Users can ask Gemini AI questions such as: Is this a good stock portfolio for long-term investment? How diversified is this stock portfolio? How to improve this stock portfolio? and more.

- ABSTRACT: App that helps you uncover root causes of various bothering conditions

*** Description:
What it does

The app helps users identify potential triggers for conditions (like acne, skin rashes, or anxiety episodes). User inputs their condition and receives AI-generated suggestions for possible triggers, (such as stress or specific cosmetics/foods). They can select or add triggers, log their presence daily, and record when the condition occurs. The app analyzes this data to suggest which triggers might be responsible and provides recommendations for managing the condition and tracking additional triggers.
All logged triggers and condition occurrences are shown in a calendar view, making it easy for users to track their well-being and quickly analyze information.
Gemini is used in two key ways:
1. It selects the most likely triggers from a predefined list based on the condition and suggests them to the user.
2. When a condition is logged, Gemini analyzes the data and provides:
1. The most likely cause based on logs, descriptions, and dates.
2. Suggestions for additional triggers to track and further details to log.
3. Recommendations for managing the condition and areas to focus on.
Additionally, Gemini is provided with a specific prompt to provide results in a specific manner.
The app is written with Flutter and Firebase and to integrate Gemini we use firebase_vertexai package.

*** Description:
What it does

Q&A for Academics, a tool created by an academic enthusiast who is passionate about making knowledge more accessible. I created this tool because it can be helpful to teachers, students, researchers, etc. As many teachers believe in the content written in the books rather than on the internet, so I build this application. With Q&A for Academics, you can ask a question or provide a topic and upload a PDF document. Our system uses the Gemini 1.5 Pro API to deliver precise answers based solely on the document's content. [Add-on] Computer vision which is an advanced branch of digital image processing is used to extract the visual contents from the pdf file. Additionally, if the document contains any figures, diagrams, images, or tables, our tool will extract these visuals. My goal is to make the process of finding and understanding academic information straightforward and comprehensive. I hope that my tool will enhance your academic journey by providing clear and informative responses to your queries. I used this tool for my END Sem examination in NIT Kurukshetra, and I got A grade (9 out of 10) in all the subjects which is a really great thing for me. Thank you!

*** Description:
What it does

DIRA AI is an innovative tool designed for architects, builders, and developers to create structures that are in harmony with their environment, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation, especially in the tropics. These are regions that have special building requirements, but often buildings fail to adequately respond to the climate. This leads to high energy consumption in buildings and even has adverse effects on the health of building occupants.
By inputting project location, building type, and desired functionalities, users can leverage AI-powered insights to optimize building designs to their micro climate. Beyond this, architects and builders can access climate data for any location on earth by simply dropping a pin on a map.

DIRA analyzes local climate data points like temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation and radiation then incorporates researched climatic design principles. It then generates tailored recommendations on building orientation, material selection, passive cooling strategies, and water management systems.
The recommendations are then fed back to Gemini to generate an image prompt which is then fed to an image generation API for users to see how the recommendations can be applied.
Gemini API is the engine that brings everything together and we look forward to continuing fine-tuning our model to provide more useful climatic design knowledge for architects, builders and developers, for a better, healthier future.

- ABSTRACT: Build online multiplayer games with Gemini

*** Description:
What it does

I created a runtime python API for Unreal Engine which allows for the creation of shapes, spawn points, vehicles, lights, and modification of environment lights. Players can join online multiplayer sandbox environments and build games through prompting. Each prompt includes the Unreal Engine python API and the player's request, such as "create a vehicle". The response from Gemini contains python code which is executed within the game to achieve the player's request. Multiple shapes can be created at once with a prompt like "Create a pyramid" (which Gemini usually builds with multiple stacked boxes). Existing shape groups can be modified by looking at the pyramid and describing some modification, like "Add an entryway with pillars". The server host can swap between Sandbox mode (where players build the game) and Game mode (where the game is played and the building abilities like prompting and flying are disabled). In Game mode, it looks for spawn points at opposing ends of the map and spawns 2 teams at the opposing spawn points. Note that the default spawn point which exists when the server is first created should be deleted, and at least 2 other spawns (representing the 2 team spawns) should be created before switching to Game mode. In the future, I'd like to add a feature to configure the game win condition with prompts, add more Unreal Engine capabilities, and add more settings like allowing players to use prompting during the Game mode.

Ý tưởng thứ 86:
Link: https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/task-dwarf
- TITLE: Task Dwarf  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Turn your chores into epic quests

*** Description:
What it does

Task Dwarf turns daily chores into quests. Players type what they want to do. An AI mentor converts the user's words into doable tasks. It then converts these tasks into quests. To simplify workflow, there's templates for common tasks (exercise, chores, pomodoros).

There's a micro story behind each tick, to motivate the player to keep going on. Once they tick everything, a success story pops up, and they are rewarded with a treasure.

There is no edit or delete task button, only a forfeit button. Players must commit to the quest! (there's a failure path too)

Gemini 1.5 Pro is used for:
- Conversations with the mentor
- Mentor turns vague sentences to simpler tasks
- More accurate task estimate by doing totals
- Better (and softer) safeguards

Gemini 1.5 Flash is used for:
- Converting boring checklists into epic quests
- Estimating each task
- Success path for each task
- Fail path for the whole quest (+ motivational talk)
- Generating treasures related to the quest

Planning to go live with this, so this could well be the final structure, though I may toss Gemini 1.5 Pro to subscribers. But Flash is cheap enough to release for free!

3. Future of Human-AI Collaboration
Debates continue about AI replacing human creativity. We often wonder if great works are human or AI-made. This issue worsens when creators hide AI involvement.
We decided to include Cupid's Lens logo on photo-poems to distinguish from human-created works.
As creators ourselves, we initially struggled with considering AI-generated works as creative. However, we were moved by Gemini's beautiful poems from our photos. It felt like viewing scenery with a poet.
Feeling hopeful about a future of co-creation with AI, we decided to develop this app. We believe this collaboration can enhance human creativity rather than replace it, opening new avenues for artistic expression.

Starting on the main page, patients, or doctors, can enter info about the patient (symptoms, etc) in a form, which will then be sent; prompting the creation of a medical report generated by the API-model (the report also includes specific instruction to medication, dosage, lifestyle, and reasoning). Doctors logged onto the site may access these generated reports, in the DoctorConnect+ section, and can determine other medical help. Also, when the form is submitted, the user can be taken to a chat portion of the website, in which the user and the API-model can chat to receive a clearer picture of the patient’s symptoms and provide medical resources (benefits in therapy, and psychoanalysis). The API-model within our site has been configured with specific personas, instructions, rules, and requirements in its system-instructions resource, to allow for medical-advice generation.

CatalystIQ serves as a platform to satisfy all the needs and services a business might require from their inception to their grand success. It creates a channel between a business and freelancers. The businesses can hire freelancers from the platform for a particular product, task or service and request their services for the period. The business posts their task, and freelancers can submit their designs for that task. Each task can have multiple subtasks, depending upon what the business owner requires. If the owner fancies any of the freelancers’ products, they can hire them for a limited duration of time until their services are no longer required. This allows for both the business and the service provider to enter into a contract limited to a few services or a defined short duration of time. For small businesses with lower budgets and fewer resources, they have the choice to not hire an employee for a service that they might need once or one with minimal maintenance. Additionally, it also benefits small and new freelancers by allowing their services to speak for them, rather than their popularity.

CatalystIQ integrates Gemini API to aid both the business and the freelancer. The business owner can generate subtasks using Gemini to better express their needs or cover any detail they might have missed. The owner can add more subtasks onto the one the API provides. The freelancer gets access to tools gain inspiration, or help them bring their products to life.

- Download on server max 15MB of file
- Devide file into smaller part, which is based on file type
- Transform file into text
- Define AI Tasks
- Interate over AI to get Suggestions
- Run AI Suggestions

This process allows to scale app into various situations , tasks, and file formats.
Currently in app available text, image, video, audio, documents and spreadsheets file formats. With only 3 tasks as rename, move and tag files.

App devides into 4 parts:
- Server: where is main logic, analyzing and processing
- Cloud Functions: to run analyzing when upload to storage
- Front-end app: something like google drive, but with minimal features
- Desktop app: watched specified dir, and tracks added files, then gives suggestions to end user

We use the Gemini API to create dynamic, lifelike patient simulations. Administrators create detailed patient scenarios, and the AI generates realistic patient responses. The cases can target a wide range of conditions and skill levels.
During the interview, the Gemini API enables natural, context-aware conversations. As the user asks questions or provides information, the AI patient responds in real-time, adapting its answers and behavior based on the conversation flow. This creates a highly realistic and unpredictable interaction, much like a real patient encounter. At any point, the user can request feedback on their performance thus far via Gemini as well. As users progress, the system dynamically adjusts the complexity and nuances of the cases, ensuring a continuous challenge that matches their growing expertise.
OSCEMentor's core functionality of AI-powered patient simulations and interactions is operational, with the real-time feedback system functional but undergoing refinement. In progress is using Imagen to dynamically generate visual representations of patients as a user progresses, as well as a more comprehensive feedback/evaluation framework for administrators.

- ABSTRACT: VivaEval is the future of school tests and assignments

*** Description:
What it does

VivaEval is designed to improve the lives of middle and high school teachers. It automates the testing and evaluation process with a type of test / assignment that cannot be easily compromised by readily available LLMs. This should save our overworked teachers 5-10 hours per week.
When the test begins, VivaEval asks the student (or user) a question and awaits a response. At this point, the app uses Gemini 1.5 Pro to:
1. Create the transcript of the audio input. (I didn’t use the audio input directly since it’s easier/faster to keep track of the entire conversation via text).
2. Conduct a sanity check to ensure that the user is not trying to access the prompt or say something irrelevant. 3. Come up with a response to the user's input; considering the conversation so far and the test outline given by the teacher.
The response is then synthesized to an audio file. When the user is done answering all questions, they are prompted to hit “End Conversation”. At this point the app has 1or 2 calls to the Gemini 1.5 Pro API to: 1. Go through the transcript of the conversation and the grading rubric; and assign a score for each point that was supposed to be covered in each question. Then compile the results into a json.
2. On some occasions the ‘json’ created in the previous point is not ‘parsable’; and so the app asks Gemini to correct the json structure.
Looking ahead, I plan to incorporate audio and video analysis into VivaEval to further enhance academic integrity.

Link: https://ai.google.dev/competition/projects/loop-2
- TITLE: Loop 2  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: From Developers for Developers

*** Description:
What it does

My app is a specialized social media platform tailored for coders and developers, providing a space for them to share their projects, connect with peers, and participate in coding challenges. The app features a home feed with posts from followed accounts and additional content based on user interests, similar to Instagram. Users can make posts related to coding or development, earn skill-based badges through exams, and engage in events like hackathons.

The Gemini API is integrated to enhance and maintain the app's focus on coding and development. Every time a user makes a post, comment, or reply to a comment, the Gemini API checks if the content is related to coding or development. If it is not, the app does not allow the post to be published. This ensures that the platform remains dedicated to discussions around coding and development.

Additionally, the Gemini API generates questions for tests automatically and provides marks based on the user's answers upon completion. This ensures that exams are fair, relevant, and accurately assess users' skills.

One unique aspect of the app is the random developer connection feature. The Gemini API is used to pair users in random video calls based on their interests, ensuring users are matched with others who have similar coding interests or expertise levels.

- ABSTRACT: A reverse-Turing-test / odd man out based game

*** Description:
What it does

Imagine a world where the line between human and artificial intelligence blurs, making perception the ultimate challenge. Welcome to Bot or Not, a revolutionary game inspired by the Turing test. Unlike traditional tests aimed at identifying robots among humans, Bot or Not challenges players to blend in as a human imposter among AI-controlled robots.

In Bot or Not, players navigate a series of tense rounds populated by "robots." However, one of these robots is actually a human imposter. The objective is clear: blend in seamlessly or risk exposure and elimination.

Each round unfolds in stages of gripping interaction. Participants engage in a conversation stage where moral questions probe ethics and reasoning, setting the stage for subtle deception and strategy.

As tension mounts, the voting phase begins. Every "robot" casts a ballot, aiming to identify the human imposter. With each elimination, the stakes rise, hinging on the player’s ability to evade detection and outwit the AI.

Victory in Bot or Not is a testament to adaptability. The player triumphs by standing among the last two robots. Defeat is humbling for those who fail to convincingly integrate into the robotic facade and fall victim to collective scrutiny.

Bot or Not offers a compelling mix of psychological challenge and strategic gameplay. Are you ready to face the mind games? Step into a world, where every word and action could mean the difference between elimination or survival.

What it does

AI Writer is a revolutionary tool that provides comprehensive support for the entire process of creating SEO articles.

Content planning is comprised of the following four steps:

1. Keyword Generation: Simply input the topic of the article you want to create, and our powerful AI engine, Gemini, will generate a list of relevant keyword candidates. This allows you to identify the optimal keywords to effectively reach your target audience.

2. Title Generation: Based on the selected keywords, Gemini will suggest five compelling title ideas from different perspectives. You can choose the most effective title and freely edit it as needed.

3. Heading Structure Generation: Based on the chosen title, Gemini automatically generates a comprehensive heading structure that outlines the entire article. This creates a logical flow that enhances readability and promotes reader comprehension. You can further optimize the article content by adding or editing headings as needed.

4. Article Generation: Using the keywords, title, and heading structure generated in the previous steps, Gemini creates a draft of the article. Instead of simply instructing it to write an article, we've trained Gemini on a curated selection of high-quality articles, enabling it to produce sophisticated writing. By prompting Gemini to "write an article as if it were written by the authors of these articles," it generates natural and engaging content that reads as if it were written by a professional writer.

DATAKI allows you to generate charts, tables, and full dashboards based on your data like never before. Currently, it is compatible with BigQuery, but support for other databases is coming soon. Simply ask for what you need through a chat interface and watch the charts and tables come to life.

# Why Create DATAKI?

In the past couple of years, we got used to interacting with computers in a conversational way. To the point where we expect it, especially in advanced tools. It feels frustrating going into Google Analytics or Looker Studio and not being able to do the same thing. So, we decided to try and implement it ourselves. We use BigQuery a lot, and it felt like a natural starting point.

# What Can You Do with It?

Imagine having a top-notch data scientist who can give you results in a beautiful way, instantly.

- DATAKI can answer questions in natural language. It can use a function to access the BigQuery data directly. Every SQL request that DATAKI makes is displayed to the user.
- CHARTS: Generate complex charts based on Charts.js. Each one includes a SQL statement and a JSON config in our own format for the visualization.
- TABLES: Automatically paginated and virtualized. Filters and sorting are coming soon.

You can also modify existing charts and tables with Gemini, even after they have been added to a dashboard. Additionally, apply date filters, copy and paste, move and resize widgets in dashboards...

- ABSTRACT: I saved my girlfriend with an event staffing A.I.

*** Description:
What it does

I replaced my girlfriend with an A.I.
She's an event coordinator and she was working so much that I never got to see her. The tipping point for me was the night she got home just before midnight and passed out exhausted, then woke up the next morning before sunrise to a phone call from her boss. She left right away wit tears in her eyes. Seeing that I decided to do something about it. So I ventured into the land of A.I. and built a bot that handles her staffing needs. It handles staffing, reminders, followups and is smart enough to know when to bubble up the conversation to a manager. After a lot of tweaking she told me it's been saving her 20 hours a week. So I opened it up to more people, and just through word of mouth it has 4 users managing 65 people.
This is a staffing a.i. for event managers and coordinators. It uses the gemini API to have a text message conversation with event staff about who's going to work what events. It also uses the gemini api to remind people about upcoming events and utilizes the function calling to schedule people, remove people from events, update availability, and even reach out to managers on behalf of an employee (this is useful in case someone is working an event and doesn't have the necessary supplies, directions, etc.). It is smart enough to automatically find the right people for a specific event (if you need a bar tender, a musician, maybe a boat captain, etc.)

Project Genesis, short of "Generative Oasis" is a prototype around somewhat Sentient and super Intelligent LLMs. Using unique prompt engineering, and RLHF, we have made the model acts just like humans, creating a new species of AI known as Cybernauts, a human like digital being. These cybernauts interacts with humans through a generalized chat Interface. The relationship between the cybernauts and humans, referred as Sapiens, is calculated by a specialized formula. During each interaction, the cybernauts generate a response along with a behavior bar, representing their emotional response like love, anger, happiness, trust etc. The cybernauts can also communicate with each other currently through a random pairing function that pairs two random cybernauts together each hour with 30% chance of communication for 5 minutes. This was done to preserve the API tokens. If the cybernauts are communicating with other bots, or humans, they are rendered offline for other users. Similarly, the application provides facilities for humans to chat as well thanks to firebase Realtime communication, as well as create chat rooms. Although the project is aimed to be Virtual city, currently it fulfills the purpose of a human-AI collaboration environment, the application has built into it, several micro-applications like code editors, writing tools, and designing tools to create content along with AI counterparts.

- ABSTRACT: Get reliable answers on Islamic jurisprudence

*** Description:
What it does

Building an AI religious counsellor, especially one that can emulate a Muslim Imam, has been a notoriously difficult challenge. The developer will be held spiritually responsible for the user being misled by hallucinations. Most abandon the task rather than take the risk.

We use Gemini to get around this challenge in a clever way. We have built a RAG app over a dataset of 145k questions on Islamic jurisprudence answered by reputable human scholars. Gemini does three things in different parts of the pipeline:

1) Expands the pool of questions by translating questions into Arabic such that we can also retrieve Arabic-language vector embeddings
2) Condenses the chat history into a standalone question such that we can keep our prompts small
3) Tailors the responses to the user based on their question and the data retrieved. We have extremely strict guardrails such that anything outside this dataset is not answered at all, and all answers are cited and linked by source down to the school of thought (madhab) and scholar, thanks to Gemini.

From our logs (Google Cloud Logging), we have found that most users ask variations of the most common questions that have been answered by humans already many times. This is ideal, as Gemini can focus on making that existing data conversational!

- ABSTRACT: Making carpools convenient and eco-friendly for campuses!

*** Description:
What it does

Most high-schools and college campuses lack a culture for carpooling, yet student transportation contributes to the 16% of carbon emissions that come from cars.

Why? Carpooling is simply not convenient. Most ridesharers aren't comfortable sharing a ride with strangers. Existing solutions are too time-consuming to setup, riddled with complicated forms and menus.

Zwisch organizes carpools within school communities, where trust and safety are key. Students can request a ride with a simple sentence.

Simply type a sentence or two about your ride details. Gemini analyzes your text and matches you with a rider/driver if possible.

The Gemini 1.5 Pro API converts natural language inputs and creates JSON ride objects. Whenever a new request or offer is created, Gemini processes all unfulfilled requests and offers at once, then matches them based on compatibility of route similarity, timing, and your preferences. A ride is created on Firebase Firestore, and notifications are sent to both users.

Zwisch was started by two friends, Alessio Toniolo and Vedic Patel who were tired of campus traffic congestion and a lack of easy-to-use apps. Alessio (18) is a senior at Marist School and Vedic (18) is a senior at South Forsyth High School. Their home of Atlanta is notorious for traffic plus a lack of accessible public transportation. The carpooling solution, Zwisch, was designed to scale for schools, colleges, and even workplaces to mitigate bad traffic and mitigate the climate crisis.

It's your responsibility to gather and manage client requirements, ensure they're up-to-date, get client approvals, and make sure nothing is overlooked. This task is daunting, especially since requirement gathering can take days, and missing essential features can lead to client dissatisfaction.

For example, if a client requests a recipe app, you might gather requirements for creating a recipe and deliver the project, but forget to include "Edit," "Delete," or "Search" features. The client, assuming these were obvious, becomes upset, straining your relationship.

The solution is ReqIt, a SaaS platform that uses AI to streamline requirement gathering. ReqIt generates requirements based on basic inputs and presents them in an easy-to-understand ERD-like map instead of a lengthy document.

Current features:
- AI-generated requirements from basic inputs in minutes.

Future features:
- Client approval and edit requests.
- A history log to track requirement changes.
- Integration with project management tools like Jira, Trello, and ClickUp.

ReqIt simplifies the process, reducing the risk of missing critical requirements and enhancing client satisfaction.

*** Description:
What it does

This service is a generative scenario app.
In this app, ai gives the basic scenario, character, and final ending, and users write several episodes in the middle.
Gemini API creates basic scenarios, sets the characters associated with them, and briefly creates a final ending accordingly.
And based on these contents, a questionnaire about the character is prepared and provided to the user. At this time, through this questionnaire, the user is assigned a character similar to his or her choice and creates a scenario.
If the number of characters is insufficient, the Gemini API also plays a role in writing scenarios by non-user characters, including the persona and scenarios of the characters that are insufficient.
And in the end, it also plays a role in organizing the results of the scenario into one.

An additional part I tried was collecting YouTube music links that were appropriate for the scenario, but there was a limit to simply bringing url due to YouTube policy issues.
In addition, we have tried prompts to create images according to scenarios and characters, but they are not included in current prototypes due to the current time required and development environment setting costs.

In the future, it will be developed so that several people can become characters in the scenario and create stories together, and Gemini will act as an agent for controlling the scenario.

And for people in various countries to try it, we check and provide languages available in Gemini API.

- ABSTRACT: Extension to search through and chat with years of browsing history

*** Description:
What it does

Imagine if you could search through everything you’ve seen on your browser: not just the public websites available on Google, but also your private web documents and notes, internal business sites, or even chats with AI bots. Imagine if you could save all that information privately and locally, without worrying about who else sees it or how much it costs.
That is what we are creating: a private, personalized search engine for everything a person has seen in their web browser. It is a browser extension with search, history, and chat.
Our application features: semantic search over previously observed text, AI chat, powered by Gemini, with search results as context, as well as screen captures to make results more recognizable. In addition, users can block URLs they don’t want remembered. Best of all, everything stored is local on the device: screen captures are saved to OPFS, embeddings are created with ONNX models, and text and vectors are saved in the browser using a WASM SQL vector database. Our combination of ONNX models and Vector DB provide KNN search results over tens of millions of words in under a second, translating to years of browsing history. Did we mention this is all local on-device? That means both private and with zero cloud costs.
For the Chat feature which rounds it all out, we currently use text-to-text models. Users can select from the Gemini API or the Ollama API for local inference. Once available, we will shift to using Gemini Nano as the default model.

- ABSTRACT: Asks users y/n questions, and then generate a personality description.

*** Description:
What it does

The app is based on the theory of personality from Florence Littauer's book, "Personality PLUS." We've refined the questions and answers to ensure a more accurate and engaging experience for users. The app asks users 20 yes or no questions, and then uses the Gemini Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a personality description based on their answers.
In the Gemini competition, we leveraged the knowledge base from the personality test to create a web application that generates 20 yes or no questions. Users answer the questions, and then send their answers to the Camge app, which uses the Gemini LLM to generate a personalized personality description.
From a technical perspective, the app is built using Angular for the frontend and Java Spring Boot for the backend. The frontend is divided into two components: "Question-ai" and "Answer-ai." The "Question-ai" component calls the "getSurveyQuestions" service, which generates the questions using Gemini. The "Answer-ai" component prints the final personality evaluation and recommendations for human improvement.
The backend is built using Java Spring Boot, and it calls Gemini's REST API using the "gemini-pro" model. Given the knowledge base from the "Personality PLUS"; Gemini generates 20 yes or no questions. In the second iteration, we send the user's answers to Gemini, and it helps us generate a personality description.

What it does

Polarity is an app that allows users to log their daily interactions and behaviors. The app uses Gemini API to analyze these entries and assigns scores based on positive or negative personality traits as well as find mentions of people. For example, helping someone in need might earn a high score for generosity, while selfish actions would receive negative points. However generous vs greed is only 1/10 vectors used for traits, there are also 8 personality disorder types used.

Polarity tracks mentions of specific people in your life, such as family members or coworkers, and uses this data to build relationship models.

The app serves as a personal development tool, allowing users to:

1. Track and quantify their behaviors
2. Gain insights into their personality traits
3. Monitor their personal growth over time
4. Understand the nature and quality of their relationships with others

These features make Polarity particularly valuable for:

- Neurodivergent users: By providing concrete feedback on social interactions, the app can help these individuals better understand and navigate complex social situations.

*** Description:
What it does

The app is a game where the 'found footage' concept is replaced by a 'found terminal'. The player is met with a command line interface for something called the Aurora Project - an old, shut-down AI. The user has access to basic commands (like ls, cat) and can explore the contents of the system. What the user doesn't initially know is that the system is the AI (this is where Gemini comes in) and it occasionally intercepts basic commands to discourage the user from exploring. The user can talk to the AI via the terminal, but the AI will remain cryptic and uncooperative until the user finds the password. The system contains logs hinting at what happened and puzzles which will lead to the password. After entering the password, the AI will reply to any questions directly and tell the user its story. The Gemini API gives the story AI life by being stubborn and cryptic and occasionally blocking the user from exploring, but then, once the password is entered, sharing its story.

- ABSTRACT: MIA uses brain waves to generate highly personal and unique art.

*** Description:
What it does

MIA captures theta waves from the brain and generates art from it.

You need to record brain signals using EEG electrodes (and a single channel EEG capture device ---> https://www.instructables.com/Recording-EEG-From-Visual-Cortex-of-Brain-Using-Bi/).

This signal gets passed to an Arduino to forward it to the computer. Signal is converted to an audio wav file that gets run through a deep learning pipeline. The seed images for the final video generation is obtained using Gemini API's vision capabilities.

After the signal conversion to an image, it is important to understand what is on the image and how to interpret it. Gemini helps in figuring that out which helps seed the video generation and come up with cool video on the other end.

*** Description:
What it does

Pixtale is an AI-powered app that transforms your trip photos and videos into narrated video stories. Here's how it works:
1. Upload: Users upload a zip file with trip media or select a Google Photos album.
2. Metadata Extraction: The app extracts date, time, and GPS data from the media.
3. AI Description Generation: This is where Gemini API shines:
- Gemini Flash generates descriptions for individual photos and videos.
- Gemini 1.5 Pro takes these descriptions as input and crafts a cohesive narrative script, scene by scene.
4. Audio Narration: Google's Text-to-Speech API converts the script into audio.
5. Video Creation: FFmpeg combines the narration with the original media to create the final video.
6. Social Media Content: Pixtale goes further by generating:
- Captions and hashtags for sharing
- A mini blog post summarizing the trip (also using Gemini 1.5 Pro)
7. User Customization: Users can edit location details for each scene using the Google Maps API.
Pixtale leverages Gemini's ability to interpret visual data, understand context, generate coherent and engaging content and craft narratives that feel personal and authentic. This AI-driven approach allows for the rapid creation of rich, multimedia travel stories that would be time-consuming to produce manually.

*** Description:
What it does

This app lets users take photos of math problems or notes to find concept explanations and related questions. You can search for similar problems in the database or snap a picture of handwritten notes, and the app will find relevant math problems for you to practice.

The app has three modes: problem-focused, explanation-focused, and a combined mode. If you want to find similar questions, use the problem-focused mode. For exploring concepts, the explanation-focused mode is recommended. Teachers have preferred the explanation-focused mode in tests.

To save costs, we included a “Text Only” option, bypassing image interpretation for problems without pictures. This app is built on a service that stores Korean math problems using vector embedding. The app automatically categorizes and vectorizes problems from PDF files, with around 15,000 problems currently stored.

The app uses vector search to find relevant problems, requiring concept and image interpretation. The Gemini API is used for concept interpretation, generating explanations that match similar embeddings in the database. We also explored image analysis but found it more complex than expected. In the future, we plan to use the Gemini API to create a user-driven database with photos, and the basic code for this is already prepared.

Liberge is a social platform designed to enhance university life by connecting students for shared activities and keeping them informed about club events. Students create profiles using their university email, specifying their name, gender, faculty, year, preferred activities, and optionally uploading photos.

The app addresses two core challenges:
1. Finding activity partners
2. Staying updated on university events.

To solve the first problem, Liberge allows students to create posts about activities they want to do, such as playing billiards. These posts are visible to students from the same university. Interested students can send requests to join, which may include personalized notes. Once a request is accepted, a chatroom is created for further discussion and planning.

For the second challenge, Liberge offers a dedicated page for student clubs to post events. Students can join these events, see who else is attending, view event details, and receive notifications as the event approaches, ensuring they never miss out.

Liberge leverages the Gemini API in its Post feature to ensure that content shared by students meets certain standards. When a student creates a post, the app validates the content in the background using Gemini API. Only if the content is deemed valid by the API, the post is allowed to be shared. This integration ensures that the platform remains safe and appropriate for all users, fostering a positive and engaging community.

*** Description:
What it does

Food waste is a global issue with profound consequences. According to The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates, In the U.S. alone, around 130 billion pounds of food are wasted each year, that is on average of more than 200 pounds of food per person!. That is a big AMOUNT! Despite having enough food to feed everyone, inefficient consumption and storage practices lead to a significant amount of waste. This not only squanders valuable resources but also contributes to climate change through the emission of potent greenhouse gasses like methane.
Our app, Smart Fridge, aims to tackle this issue head-on. By leveraging Gemini’s powerful AI, we’ve developed a solution that helps users manage their food inventory more effectively, ensuring that no food item goes unnoticed or unused. Our app sends reminders about approaching expiration dates of food items and With the help of Gemini’s powerful AI, generates recipes based on the ingredients users already have stored in the app and offers a receipt scanning feature, where users can easily add items to their app inventory. These functionalities ensures that users can minimize waste while still enjoying varied and nutritious meals

The application addresses the issue of social inequality in education and lifelong learning.
Educational inequality is the unequal distribution of educational resources and opportunities, which can lead to unequal educational outcomes. This can be based on a number of factors, including socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, disability, and language.
Educational inequality can have a significant impact on individuals and society as a whole. For individuals, it can limit their opportunities for personal and professional development, and can lead to lower earnings and poorer health outcomes. For society, it can lead to increased social stratification and a less educated workforce.
Personalized learning with AI (my app) is available to everyone equally.
Moreover, lifelong learning may be important for all people.
Lifelong learning is the ongoing, voluntary pursuit of knowledge and skills for either personal or professional reasons. There are many benefits to lifelong learning. It can help you:

*** Description:
What it does

Our app transforms live streaming into an interactive experience where viewers can ask questions via YouTube chat and receive real-time answers from an AI-driven avatar of Einstein. The app leverages the Gemini API to process and generate responses to audience questions. When a question is received, it is sent to the Gemini API for a response, while simultaneously being converted to audio via a text-to-speech service. This audio is then synced with a lipsync-enabled Einstein avatar in Unity3D, creating the illusion that Einstein is speaking directly to the viewers. The entire process is streamed live on YouTube, allowing viewers to see their question, name, and photo displayed on screen as Einstein responds. To ensure smooth operation, questions are queued and processed sequentially, with both the questions and responses managed in an orderly fashion. The integration of the Gemini API is key to providing accurate and timely responses, making the experience dynamic and engaging for users.

*** Description:
What it does

This application estimates the amount of work for your tasks. By inputting the title and description of a task, you can get divided sub-tasks along with an estimated time for each one.

After getting the result, you can track your actual work using a stopwatch specifically designed to be used alongside the generated tasks on the same screen. We use a ring to display the estimated time and current progress, which automatically adjusts based on the situation.

This application uses Gemini API to generate estimations. We input the task title and description into the prompt, along with our base prompt, which instructs the LLM to generate a CSV containing the title, notes, and estimated time for each task. The prompt is also incorporates historical data recorded for each user, making estimations more accurate as they continue to use the app. This means that each user gets tailored results optimized for their individual needs. For example, the LLM can recognize if a user struggles with certain tasks and adjust the time estimations accordingly.

All of this information is stored in a Firestore database. This enables us to offer additional features, such as identifying the right person for a task by analyzing the historical estimated and actual times of all users or users in a specific group. Ultimately, this contributes to a more optimized society.

For decades, funders have been trying to address the gaps in funding mechanisms for underserved and under-represented organizations - so that the neediest communities have a voice in planning processes for local infrastructure such as factories, transportation, renewable energy, hospitals, etc, and receive appropriate resources. We are exploring two uses for Gemini : (1) enabling a new government or community staff member to create an Environmental Justice profile, and (2) creating an interactive database and map of key community based organizations - both at a specified location. Our goal is to elevate the strengths of small non-profits and small businesses serving underserved communities by showcasing their services, geographies and demographics served, and capacity (e.g., staff and budget) with the entities that are making funding, policy, and development decisions in their communities (e.g., governments and corporations). By doing this, we anticipate improving equity in the procurement process with government agencies, developers, and funders as this process is often dominated by larger or well established organizations.
We use the broader Text Generation feature of Gemini to create local Environmental Justice summaries. We use the AQA (Attributed Question Answering) feature of Gemini to extract structured data out of unstructured websites.

*** Description:
What it does

You want to access a specific file. For a sighted user, you simply click to enter the Documents folder and click again to open the file. Done.

But what if you're visually impaired? You'd use a blind reader, such as macOS's VoiceOver. So you open a file manager window, and VoiceOver describes, in detail, what it is and can do (every time you use it!). You use complex keyboard actions to navigate to the sidebar. Whenever you interact with your device, VoiceOver repeats information about the focused UI element. You then go down the list of folders, one by one, with VoiceOver announcing every folder's name until you finally hear the correct folder. The process is repeated inside the folder until you find your desired file. Wasn't that exasperating?

A quiet two-click task turns into a yakking, tiresome dozen-action operation.

What if you could complete the same task simply by instructing, "In the Documents folder, open my vaccination document"? My app, GUI Dog, does that.

The user gives GUI Dog precise instructions for a task. GUI Dog provides Gemini with the task to achieve and a list of UI elements it can manipulate. Gemini then specifies what actions to take, and GUI Dog uses the macOS accessibility system to execute them. Together, they work towards completing the task.

GUI Dog aims to be the "seeing eye" for the visually impaired, using Large Language Model technologies to help uplift the disadvantaged, enhancing their interactions with the digital world.

*** Description:
What it does

The DDMD project aims to provide an AI-powered solution for detecting digital drug music. The process begins with the collection of 3,176 non-copyrighted MP3 files, of which 1,676 are classified as digital drug music and 1,500 as not digital drug music.
These files are used to develop a Random Forest-based model that can classify audio files as either digital drug music or not. The model utilizes 34 features extracted from these audio files, covering both frequency and time-domain characteristics, and has achieved very encouraging results.
To make the results accessible and user-friendly, we developed a web application. This application leverages the trained Random Forest model to classify audio files through a simple and intuitive interface. The DDMD web application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. It utilizes the pre-trained Random Forest model to make predictions, accepting various audio file formats, converting non-MP3 files to MP3, and allowing input via a YouTube URL.
Additionally, to enhance classification accuracy, we are exploring ways to improve the DDMD application by fine-tuning the Gemini-1.5-flash model. We have proposed two approaches: first, we prepared a JSON dataset based on the Random Forest classifier results to fine-tune the Gemini-1.5-flash model. In the second approach, we are using the Gemini API and experimenting with different input formats, including CSV and JSON, to fine-tune this Gemini model.

- ABSTRACT: Fireview is a Notion UI for your Firestore data

*** Description:
What it does

Fireview brings the modular, multi-player, no-code experience of Notion to Firestore devs/teams/agencies who want to visualize and manage their data or build admin panels in minutes.

Within a Fireview workspace, you can connect multiple Firebase projects, and for each you can import any collections from any database. From the sidebar, you can easily access the imported collections and view data by creating table views (which let you apply filters, sorts and customize the layout of fields, etc).

Similar to Notion databases, you can easily open individual documents and see their data on a side drawer. This drawer allows you to customize how you want documents for that collection to look through a drag and drop grid.

Another key element of Fireview are pages, where you can create custom dashboards that bring together data from different collections, databases and even firestore projects. The first GenAI feature of Fireview can be found in the lower tool panel of the page. Here you can simply describe the data you want to see, and Fireview will add a table block to the page connected to the right data with the right filters. Under the hood this uses Fireview’s robust schema inference and Firebase Genkit’s tool calling functionality, which directly interacts with the Fireview database and the Gemini API.

- Record daily expenses.
- Restore information on the user's expenses.
- Create graphs from the user's expenses.
- Provide analysis and advice based on graphs.
- Create csv files of expenses based on user requests.

To perform these tasks, the bot uses several technologies:

1) Gemini: the bot uses several agents based on Gemini to perform the tasks listed above. Each agent has a specific role. These include :

- an agent that recognizes the user's intent.
- an agent that creates sql queries based on the user's request.
- an agent that creates the json to record an expense.
- an agent that creates code for graphics.
and more...


2) Google cloud APIs: Vision and Speech to text are the 2 Google APIs used for this bot. This allows users to send voice messages and images of their invoices directly to the bot. For example, when the user sends an image of an invoice, cloud vision performs the OCR and Gemini will create the json that will record the ticket information.

3) Big Query and cloud storage: The bot interacts with a BQ table, which groups all recorded expenses. It will also retrieve information from this table. When the user sends an image, in addition to recording the expenses on big query, the bot will also save the image in a cloud bucket to archive the invoice with a specific ID (which matches the relevant expense ID in BQ) .

In the editor, pressing the Tab key will generate new text to keep your story going. You can even choose an AI partner to switch up the themes and style of the text that gets generated, making your story truly unique.
I integrated the Gemini API to help with the writing process. It helps users by generating text, making sure what’s created flows naturally with your story. Plus, it helps keep the content clean and safe, so you can focus on the fun parts—like crafting an epic tale or diving into someone else’s world. Whether you’re here to write, read, or both, this app is all about creativity and connection.
I'm using firebase for the backend, react & typescript for the front end. I used different prompts for the Gemini API to generate text. I'm also using the perspective API to make sure that the titles are safe. I plan to add more features such as editing, autosave, collaboration, image generation and much mode.

- ABSTRACT: An eye-controlled communication system for ALS patients

*** Description:
What it does

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, is a devastating disease that takes away the patient’s ability to move and speak. As a volunteer in ALS associations during the summers of high school, I realized that some patients can only communicate with their eyes and assistive technology, which has many limitations like cost and efficiency. Powered by the Google Gemini API, my free multi-language app named “Gaze Link” helps ALS patients communicate with their eyes independently, accurately, and efficiently.

First, I recognize the user’s face and eyes with Google ML Kit and OpenCV. After a 30-second calibration and setting adjustments, the user can begin typing words on Gaze Link’s multi-language keyboard with 6 eye gestures. However, eye-typing can be a very slow process for long sentences.

To improve the text-entry rate, I used a Gemini 1.5 Flash model to generate the patient’s intended sentence based on keywords and the context. First, Gaze Link will transcribe the caretaker’s voice into text like “Is the room temperature ok?”. Then, the patient will type keywords like “hot, AC, two” with their eyes. The Gemini model will use the information to generate a suitable sentence like “I am hot, can you turn the AC down by 2 degrees?” in under a second. The model and keyboard also works with Spanish and Chinese. Experiments with 30 people show that the model can save up to 85% of user keystrokes and make Gaze Link 7x more effective than traditional E-transfer boards.

What it does

First, during the process of creating the roadmap, the Gemini API is used to generate an outline for the course based on the topics users search for. For each content item in the outline, we use the Google Search API to search for resources (text, video) combined with certain ranking algorithms to suggest materials to users.

Additionally, the Gemini API plays an important role in automatically generating questions based on the lesson content. To address the hallucination issue of large language models (LLMs), we employ Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve information relevant to this lesson.

Finally, to create personalization, we store the test results for each lesson and use them as data for Gemini to analyze the user's learning process, including identifying areas where the user has not fully grasped the material and recommending review sessions.

What it does

Agrum.ai is an app with the ambitious goal to help people improve their diet and the quality of what they eat based on the analysis of their meals. Our purpose is to make it easy to achieve by using artificial intelligence to both enhance user experience and the results. First, the app asks you to take a full picture of your dish (one picture is required per dish). The picture is then analyzed by Gemini. Quantities, meal's name, meal's ingredients are automatically determined by Gemini. Then multiple databases are used to retrieve nutritional information based on Gemini's findings. Gemini is once again involved in the matching process. Once the results are available, they are displayed to the user who then has the ability to adjust the quantities for better results. In addition, and in an effort to raise awareness about environment, the results also display an estimated carbon and water footprint for the meal.
Once satisfied, the user can save the meal to their history. In their history, users have access to charts to follow their calories intake per day, nutrients and their evolution day after day. The goal here is to provide people who have a global objective (loose weight, specific nutrients intake...) the means to do so. Finally, the app relies once again on Gemini to suggest recipe based on the history to users which are both good for one's health and good for the environment.

MERLIN is an innovative video search platform that revolutionizes video content discovery and access. By ingeniously combining Gemini Flash and Vertex multimodal embedding techniques, MERLIN delivers a seamless and intuitive video search experience tailored precisely to your intent.

At its core, MERLIN integrates large language models and cutting-edge multimodal embeddings. When you submit an initial text query, our backend extracts the query embedding and performs a vector search against pre-computed video embeddings. However, if the results don't quite hit the mark, you can engage in a natural conversation with MERLIN, powered by Gemini Flash.

As you converse, MERLIN leverages Vertex to extract multimodal embeddings from the dialogue, capturing the nuanced context of your needs. These are interpolated with the initial query embedding, and a new vector search is performed against the video database.

Throughout this process, vector embeddings and metadata are seamlessly stored in Firestore, while the actual videos and thumbnails reside in Firebase, ensuring a smooth and responsive experience.

By harnessing the combined power of Gemini Flash's conversational AI and Vertex's multimodal capabilities, MERLIN truly understands your video search intent like never before, surfacing the most relevant and accurate results.

This Project is derived from our work MERLIN: Multimodal Embedding Refinement via LLM-based Iterative Navigation for Text-Video Retrieval-Rerank Pipeline.

Mad Puck is a hockey team management and stats solution for minor hockey and pickup teams.
We have created a new service and integrated Gemini to support post game interviews and post game reports. During a game the fans enter game events into Mad Puck (time, shots, faceoffs, goals, penalties, etc.). When the game has finished, Mad Puck selects 2 players to conduct post game interviews with and then generates interview questions using Google Gemini and the game context for the prompt. The interview questions are pushed to the players devices (using Firebase Messaging) and the players respond to the interview questions. Once the interviews are complete Mad Puck again uses Gemini to generate a post game report using the context of the game and the interviews for the Gemini prompt. The completed report is sent to the fans to enjoy. The coach can set a persona for the interviewer which Gemini will use when creating the reports - for example on our sample team, we use, you are "a reporter who thinks he is a pirate".
Mad Puck uses many Firebase products to support this new service; please see the README in the source code.

- TITLE: Audio Description Generator  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Create descriptive audio tracks for YouTube videos within minutes.

*** Description:
What it does

The Audio Description Generator app is a tool for creating descriptive audio tracks for short YouTube videos within minutes. Once given a YouTube link, the app fetches the video, title, and description. It then begins by splitting the video into smaller chunks. These chunks, alongside the YouTube data, are first used to create a "context file" using Gemini, this acts as a first pass to detect general details and identify any characters. Then each chunk is used to make a "loudness file" which measures the volume at every interval and a "transcript" (using Gemini) which lists the dialogue from the video with timestamps. All this information is then fed to Gemini once again to create a "script" of observations with timestamps. These scripts are then put through Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech, the resulting audio is stitched back together, and the final result is presented to the user.

- TITLE: Work Buildup  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Fast Planning and real-time Tracking

*** Description:
What it does

No plan survives contact with reality.
The only benefit of planning lies in the forward-thinking process itself. However, a plan's usefulness diminishes rapidly if it remains unchanged. To maintain its value, a plan must continuously evolve in response to new information and changing circumstances. Plans have to be thoughtfully complete, yet need to be constantly adaptive to be of the most use.
WorkBuildup is an approachable project planning tool to:
- quickly decompose complex project work into smaller, more bite size tasks, as well as quickly articulate realistic expectations based on current knowledge of a project,
- encourage constant iterative planning and project tracking through extremely easy viewing and updating, and highlight the consequences of changes to the work plan as new information is discovered. - provide immediate visual feedback on progress and potential hotspots in the work.
- for those who are on the front line, as well as all those in between, the work breakdown structure provides context so there is a better understanding of the "why" behind the work.
Google Gemini powers the WorkBuildup task generation process by aiding, in a careful human-in-the-loop way, the breakdown of work into detailed steps at each level. This dramatically accelerates the planning process and allows users to very quickly craft the details of work, sometimes even capturing work that wasn't previously considered or was outside the mind-frame of the user.

GEMLINGO is your ultimate language learning companion. GEMLINGO tailors your experience to fit your unique goals and schedule. It is built with Flutter and uses Firebase for backend. With a simple registration process, GEMLINGO creates a personalized learning roadmap just for you. And this roadmap is generated by using the capabilities of the Gemini 1.5 pro model. A carefully designed prompt is send to Gemini to get an output in json. This json output is used to create the weekly plan cards. The Roadmap is also stored in firestore, hence roadmap is generated only once during the onboarding process. All the available data from the roadmap is passed to the gemini 1.5 pro model again in a carefully designed prompt to generate activities in realtime. The output from the model is obtained in a json format which later is parsed and different activity screens are rendered in flutter. The activities also offer an immediate doubt clearance chat session with a friendly teacher chatbot which is based on the multi turn conversation feature of gemini 1.5 pro. Since this chat bot remembers all the context of the conversation and also knows about the user performance in the activities, it can provide effective and tailored doubt solving. The Gemlingo Superchat uses the multimodal capabilities of gemini to get answers to any question. Gemlingo Interpreter uses the multi turn conversation feature of gemini 1,5 pro combined with packages like speech-to-text in flutter.

FindIt is a fresh take on gaming that blends artificial intelligence with exciting challenges. The Home and Run mode in the game requires player to find random object in the chosen location, ones players find the object they click a picture of it, and this is where gemini comes into play; the gemini-1.5-flash model is then used to first authenticate if the picture actually contains the required object, if it does then it checks if the object is real or showed as an image in any device screen such as a monitor, this is done to avoid cheating in the game. Additionally the Third game mode 'Riddle Rush' uses the gemini-1.5-pro model, in this mode random object's name is selected from our predeclared array and then gemini is used to make a riddle out of it, then when the user inputs the answer gemini is again used to check the answer to see if it's correct, this allows a range of acceptable answer rather than a single word like other riddle apps, also if the user inputs a wrong answer then gemini explains how that particular answer is wrong. The app also uses Firebase to authenticate users and store all data. Overall Gemini is the heart of the app.

*** Description:
What it does

What's unique is that someone who only knows the basics of Android Studio created this app through conversations with gemini.

It's a game where a cute character learns Korean conversation in a fun way while going through a store in the game through a quest. Not only does it respond in real time to the user's level through conversations with NPCs using the gemini API, but you can also receive natural feedback on intonation, pronunciation, etc. You can also save sentences you don't know and learn them by looking them up when talking to users or NPCs.

You can collect learning points and exchange them for money or coins, or buy game items to decorate your character or house.

You can learn various languages ​​through country maps and experience the culture that you can only know by living in that country, such as landmarks, culture, and dialects.

We used the Gemini API to dynamically generate language prompts and feedback. When users attempt a task, the app sends their input to the Gemini API, which processes the text and returns contextual feedback. This feedback helps users improve their language skills by providing corrections or suggestions based on the accuracy of their responses. The API also adapts the difficulty level of tasks, ensuring a personalized learning experience.

By leveraging the Gemini API, our app offers real-time, AI-driven language assistance, making language learning both engaging and effective for users.

- ABSTRACT: Transcribes doctor-patient conversations into medical records

*** Description:
What it does

The app uses the Google AI Client SDK of Gemini AI to transcribe natural conversations between doctors and patients into medical records, saving time for physicians, reducing typing, and increasing the time spent with patients. The app converts everyday language into medical terminology. For example, it transforms common words like "redness" into medical terms such as "erythema."

By harnessing the power of Gemini AI, the app can offer medical recommendations based on the patient’s diagnostic impression, even if these recommendations were not explicitly mentioned in the original conversation. This might include suggesting laboratory tests, imaging studies, or specific treatments.

After generating the text, users can create a new version of it. Once satisfied with the result, they can copy or share it.

Currently, the application only accepts text inputs due to a limitation in the Google AI Client SDK, which only supports text and image inputs. However, I have successfully tested creating a server with the Gemini API that processes audio into medical conversations.

The contextual capabilities of the Gemini API were utilized to adapt its chat functionalities, enabling the creation of personalized stories that involve the children, their caregivers, and the AI in a collaborative storytelling process.

Additionally, we harnessed Gemini’s vision capabilities, allowing users to take photos of their toys and favorite characters and create stories related to them. This feature adds a layer of interactivity and personalization that enriches the overall experience for the children.

By combining the power of AI and the versatility of the Gemini API, our app offers a groundbreaking storytelling experience that nurtures the imagination and intellect of children while providing a safe and engaging environment for learning.

- ABSTRACT: Translate &amp; Lip-sync your videos into any language.

*** Description:
What it does

Langflip relies heavily on the Gemini Multimodal API. It will send the original video to Gemini and ask Gemini to :
1. Generate captions for the videos, one of the main complexities of translating videos is maintaining the rhythm of the original video. For example, if we want to translate an English video into German, it is very likely that the translation will have more words and will be longer than the original video. Gemini gives the ability to detect when the speaker takes a break and group the caption until a break.
2. Generate the translations, again, we want to maintain the rhythm of the original videos. Google Translate will provide a literal translation of the original sentences. However, we want translations that are more or less the same length as the original video. Gemini gives the ability to generate translations with more or less the same number of characters than the original sentence translated.
3. Detect which frames need to be lip-synced, we want to send only the frames where the speaker is clearly visible and talking to the lip-syncing AI model. If we send frames with no visible face to the AI, it might crash and fail the lip-syncing process. Gemini provides the ability to send the video and receive all the timestamps where the speaker appears in the video.

In the past we had to create a detector for each function to know whether we should run that function or not. But now we have LLMs like Gemini. And we can create a set of functions and Gemini can decide which function to give to the user. And the interface will also offer the complete interface of the software to design so that it fits the request promptly. The focus is on research, codding and elearning. For research, we use a kind of memory logic so that Gemini doesn't jump out of the context, and we use the JSON formatting of the response, which helped us maximize the accuracy of the response. Since we were all students and had enough experience in text writing, research and work, we optimized that. Through our dataset creation tool, every frontend learner can now use our platform to work with dynamic data. Learning a language helps people to focus specifically on their own careers. For this project we used React, Firebase, Firestore, ExpressJs, Python.

So we want to make the lives of new generations easier because the possibilities of AI make this possible, and not use software from the 90s like Word for life.

- TITLE: IRIS 1  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: From Damage Control to Damage Prevention

*** Description:
What it does

Iris transforms the way people and businesses censor sensitive data in mass.

Millions of users share videos on social media everyday. However, the current system struggles to detect and remove sensitive information in real-time. Videos containing passwords and personally identifiable information (PII) like addresses, credit card details and IDs are frequently taken down only after user reports, which can be too late since the information has already been leaked.

This is where Iris steps in. By analyzing visual data for any sensitive data leaks before the video is published, we can solve the problem at its source.

Here's how it works: Clients upload their videos through an API request. These videos are encrypted in Firebase, processed on GCP, and analyzed for sensitive info. Our internal database of sensitive info is collected only on the consent of our users, who receive a decrease in their subscription fee. This data will then be deleted after a 30 day retention period. A report is generated, allowing clients to customize blur settings. Finally, IRIS returns a censored video with requested PII blurred.

We use Google Gemini 1.5 Pro to analyze any potential information leak. Additionally, we use RAG to retrieve any matches to our internal sensitive ino database. Google Gemini allows us to detect sensitive data from a semantic perspective. So more complex cases of PII and password leakage like mirrored or occluded texts can also be detected.

*** Description:
What it does

1PUL (1st Place You Look, pronounced "one pull") is a Flutter web app (prototype) that inventories items moved by people, and has an interface to search the inventory. In an environment with many items and lots of storage options (like a busy household or an office), it can be challenging to 1) track down the last place an item was seen, and 2) have all the items in mind when trying to solve a problem or fulfill a list. 1PUL can also be used to actively inventory a collection of items.
When the Flutter code detects movement from the camera by comparing frames, it hits the Gemini API with a camera frame and a prompt like, "if there's a person holding an object, and the object is clearly visible, describe the object". Gemini's object description, plus the still image url, camera location, and (optionally) transcribed audible comments from the person, are written to a Google Sheet. The still image is uploaded to a GCS bucket. The capturing device running 1PUL will also briefly show that an item is being inventoried.
Inventory Search is a feature that sends a user query (ex: "what camping gear do I have", "where's my socket wrench") to the Gemini API, along with the full inventory descriptions (thanks for the giant context window!), with a prompt like, "match this user query to the most relevant item descriptions". There's some prompting to get structured output, which the dart code maps back to inventory items to present to the user.

What it does

Description:

In Kenya, after a long day of work and battling traffic, the common question in many households is, "Tutakula nini?"—meaning "What are we eating today?" This question resonates with everyone, from the bachelor in Nairobi to the mother of four in Mombasa. However, the answer often revolves around a limited range of staples like rice, ugali, and chapati. This lack of dietary diversity can negatively impact gut health, immunity, and overall well-being.

Problem Statement:

Many Kenyans rely on a narrow set of staple foods, leading to a lack of dietary variety that affects gut health and overall wellness.

Solution:

Introducing FYG, a Gemini-powered web app that promotes gut health through personalized meal plans rooted in Kenyan cuisine. By leveraging the power of Gemini, FYG tailors meal plans and grocery lists based on individual user profiles, ensuring a balanced and diverse diet.

Target Audience:

Health-conscious Kenyans looking to diversify their diets and improve their gut health.

Gemini API Integration:

FYG uses the Gemini API to generate personalized meal plans and grocery lists. Users provide details such as age, gender, height, weight, activity level, goals (e.g., weight loss or muscle gain), allergies, medical conditions, dietary restrictions, and preferences. These inputs are processed through Gemini's AI, which outputs a detailed meal plan and corresponding grocery list tailored to each user's needs.

*** Description:
What it does

In this app, designed to resemble an antique sketchbook, you’ll be drawing. The pictures you draw in this sketchbook come to life, literally moving and breathing.
The sketchbook is inhabited by a demonic relic. This relic feeds on the creatures and food you create, building up its power. It demands you draw specific things because it needs specific types of nourishment at different times. Meanwhile, you must also draw pictures to rescue people trapped within the sketchbook.
You and the relic have different goals, but you share a common need: to draw. The relic will use words to entice, praise, and scold you in order to get what it wants. You can’t let its words completely sway you, but listening for occasional hints it drops is key to clearing the game. You'll be navigating the story by both utilizing and being utilized by the relic.
The relic’s reactions to your drawings will keep things interesting. You might even find yourself growing fond of its efforts to manipulate you.
Gemini’s power is essential to bringing this unique and fascinating relic, both enemy and partner, to life. Gemini judges what is drawn, offers feedback, and generates dialogue appropriate to the situation. The app also uses AI technologies beyond Gemini, such as pose estimation AI, to animate the drawn images. This is truly an innovative work that harnesses the power of AI.

For that reason, I decided to integrated a specialized model (Grounding DINO) as a tool that can help the Gemini agent perform better at robot detection. Once the robot is detected on the grid we can ask the agent other complex tasks like plan a path to move the robot from one location to another one and even send control commands to execute the path with ROS bridge integration.

What it does

CodeRes.ai is an web app that enables scientists and researchers to review scientific literature faster and with more clarity and to extract meaningful insights from figures in relation to raw data and code, as well as replicate data and figures from papers by generating code given said figures.
All the user has to do is to upload a picture of said figure from a related paper, and CodeRes.ai would be able to generate code for the plots within said figure, with succinct accompanying explanations.
The Gemini API is queried with the figure, and an accompanying prompt, and generates code for the figures in a given prompt. The code is plot based, and sample data is also generated for the given use case. One would also be able to generate code from said figures in multiple languages: Python, R, Matlab, Java and C++.
The use of CodeRes.ai would enable scientists and researchers formulate computational pipelines with said code, to enhance the reproducibility of scientific data and substantiation of published literature data with a Gemini-powered click. It would also expand accessibility to individuals with learning disabilities comprising those with ADHD and dyslexia, who work in academia, and might have a difficult time parsing through dense computational papers in a streamlined manner, and would bridge the gap between coding tutorials and their real-world use cases in scientific papers, for researchers looking to integrate computational workflows in their research process.

- ABSTRACT: GenesisGuild is for generating multiplayer RPG games in text format

*** Description:
What it does

GenesisGuild is an API for generating multiplayer RPG games in text format, where it is possible to create sessions and interact in a structured way, all done using the Google Gemini API.

To create a session, you need to provide the game genre, a description for the world in which the story will take place, and a description of the mission.

Once the session is created, the API provides an ID, which will be necessary for all operations in this session.

Here is an endpoint for querying session data.

In this endpoint, we can add players, providing a name and a description of that player.

Let's add 3 players to our session.

When creating a new player, the API returns the session information.

After all players have been created, it is necessary to start the session, where the instructions will be effectively sent to Gemini to process.

The API returns a description of the round, which contains the relevant information for the current round.

A mission for each player, and 3 action options for each one to follow their adventure.

Now, each player must choose their action for this round, and so on. Once everyone has been chosen, the next round begins

The API return has a new description, containing the effects of the previous actions, new missions for each player, and new action options for each one

And it continues like this until the team has completed the mission set at the beginning

*** Description:
What it does

AiiRE, Ai in Real Estate, improves the lives of anyone who wants to buy or sell a home by filling a gap in the real estate process: providing real time market analysis using our Home Market Index (HMI) framework to answer questions on your local market prior to listing or putting in an offer. Our HMI analysis creates a 1.5x1.5 mile grid system over the entire state of Massachusetts and acts as custom neighborhoods. The analysis takes raw data from the multiple listing service and aggregates closed prices, closed sales, listed prices, listed homes, price per sqft, days on market, valuation accuracy, land sales, and land listings daily for each custom grid. This data is then given to Gemini through prompt injection based on the neighborhood you are interested in, which allows Gemini to be your market analyst. Have a question on how much should you offer on a home? AiiRE can assist by looking at the Closed vs Listed Prices of that neighborhood and offer a range to assist. Want to know how long it will take to sell your home? AiiRE can help there as well, looking at the Days On Market for that area and advise on how long it most likely will take. All of this information is currently lacking in today’s real estate world, which is why the goal for AiiRE is twofold: 1) To assist realtors with complex market questions and analysis and 2) be a barometer for listings on Zillow, Redfin, or other sites and offer direct insights and answers to people wanting to buy or sell a home

Determining gluten-free status requires considering various factors such as the product, packaging, and manufacturing facilities. Using Gemini's Image and Video capabilities, the app creates a list of gluten-free products from local supermarkets and combines these to generate optimal recipes. Many individuals with wheat allergies struggle to prepare meals due to the complexity of identifying safe ingredients and creating suitable recipes. This app aims to simplify the process by leveraging advanced technology to scan and analyze products in local stores. It not only identifies gluten-free items but also considers their nutritional value and compatibility in recipes. By providing users with a comprehensive database of safe ingredients and suggesting creative meal ideas, the app empowers those with dietary restrictions to enjoy a wider variety of delicious, home-cooked meals. This innovative solution addresses a significant challenge in the lives of people with gluten sensitivities, potentially improving their quality of life and dietary options.

*** Description:
What it does

Beyond Canvas goes beyond canvas to help artists expand their boundaries. I'm a fine arts student myself and have aspired living as an artist. The reality is: no network means no connections to galleries and no chance of being able to exhibit your paintings. I thought about this unfairness and decided make Beyond Canvas.

There are two parts to this app that make it a platform. It provides benefits to both sellers(artists) and buyers. We're not talking about monumental priced art piece buyers but an ordinary person who has interest in collecting arts. First, with ARCore, the app provides limitless stage of exhibition for artists. Even if you are in Austin, you can exhibit your painting in the middle of Paris and who knows how much more you can go with this potential? For buyers on the other hand, the ARCore provides a system where they can view the art through their phone directly and even try it in their houses.

Additionally, Gemini 1.5 Pro has provided some key features to making this platform work. By using the API, the app is able to not only allow artists their works around the world, but it helps artists pinpoint cities to exhibit on. Not only that, Gemini helps to set the range of price for paintings. This is extremely helpful when the new artists are not aware of how much their works cost.

And finally, Gemini helps to make the storytelling of the artworks possible for users with disabilities for they read the art, with eyes of their hearts. So...what's your story?

*** Description:
What it does

Even after having contract management systems in large and medium sized companies, there are many customised contracts with customers and suppliers in B2B environment which require periodic review. Identifying revenue leakages or cost leakages through contracts is a tedious job that requires manual intervention to interpret them. Hence, most of the medium to large organisations maintain separate teams to review contracts.
Generative AI and LLMs can be used to aid contract interpretation teams to review the contracts and provide alerts at the right time for proper enforcement of contractual terms, based on spend and revenue information from ERP.
According to a study, approximately there is 9% revenue leakage and 9% cost leakage in organisations globally due to contract mismanagement, interpretation and enforcement difficulties.
We have used Gemini API to fetch highlights from contract like timeline of events, vendor details, summary of important clauses (like payment, interest rate for late payment, CPI), discounts and rebates on various products.
We have also implemented RAG using Google embeddings to search across all the contracts in the system.

BioDetect is an educational web app that helps you identify plants, animals, and insects using just a photo. Simply upload an image, and the app will give you a concise, easy-to-digest information about the organism.

At its heart, BioDetect uses a powerful Python FastAPI backend. This backend takes the uploaded image and sends it to the Google Gemini-1.5-Flash API. Gemini analyzes the image and sends back a detailed description. The backend then processes this description, picking out key details like the species, characteristics, and habitat of the organism.

The BioDetect frontend, built with React, makes this information easy to understand. It shows the uploaded image alongside the detailed findings from the backend. To make the experience even more engaging, we’ve included an animated 3D model of a butterfly, created with WebGi technology. This model adds an immersive element, making learning about different organisms both fun and informative.

Our application automates these time-consuming processes to deliver actionable plans to emergency response teams. Leveraging real-time and multi-modal data sources including social media and sensor streaming data, Pytho can plot a safe rescue route for teams to reach victims, recommend areas to prioritize rescue efforts, and optimize resource employment to save critical time and materials.
We use Gemini API for:
1) Building our cloud-based user facing application.
2) To build a workflow manager that can extract statement of work from a video capture. Similar to ÉCLAIR (arXiv:2405.03710v1)

*** Description:
What it does

Recycling Advisor 3D is a web app where you can upload a photo and receive recycling advice from a talking 3D avatar. If applicable, the avatar also suggests the nearest recycling center that accepts the type of items shown in the photo. Local government entities responsible for waste management can embed the app as a component on their websites to promote proper disposal methods and help their residents. Each component can be localized to include information about local recycling centers and local guidelines. It is also possible to change the 3D character, language, and/or voice. By making recycling easy, fun, and engaging, the app helps protect the environment.

The app uploads the photo to Gemini using its File API and makes multimodal Gemini API calls utilizing multi-turn function calling. In the first turn, Gemini classifies the items in the photo and asks for more detailed information based on the category of the items. The final text response stream is directed to an animated 3D avatar that can speak and lip-sync in real-time using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech AI voices, accompanied by subtitles for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Gemini not only generates the response for the avatar to speak but also controls its gestures and facial expressions using keywords and emojis. The nearest local recycling center is calculated based on the Gemini response and the user's location and is presented with a map generated by the Google Maps Static API.

*** Description:
What it does

Our primary goal was to provide each user with a unique and personalized travel experience. We are proud to say that we have successfully achieved this goal by leveraging the power of the Gemini, which allowed us to access a vast amount of data related to various location categories.
We used this data to formulate specific questions for the users, such as their preferred travel time, types of tourism they're interested in, and dietary restrictions. This helped us better understand the users' preferences and needs.
Once we gathered this information, we utilized the Gemini again to craft a travel plan that was as unique as the user. This plan was tailored to the user's responses, dynamic, and capable of adjusting to the user's travel duration. For instance, if a user planned a 7-day trip, our system would generate a 7-day itinerary filled with activities and places to visit that matched the user's preferences.
Moreover, we ensured the travel plan was flexible and could be adjusted based on real-time factors. For instance, if a user wants to start their travel plan later in the day or finish earlier, our system can accommodate these changes.
Using the Gemini allowed us to create a highly personalized and dynamic travel planning experience for our users. It was like having a personal travel assistant who knew your preferences and could adapt the plan on the fly. This project was a great example of how technology can enhance personalization and flexibility in the travel industry.

*** Description:
What it does

Greengrade is an app capable of mathematically quantifying and standardizing the concept of sustainability using Sustainability Interval Index (SII) analysis. We leverage Google’s Gemini's ability to summarize and find values from Sustainability Reports, Quarterly Financial Statements, or databases to gather the data necessary to provide an accurate score for a particular company.

Originally, to test out our model, we manually inputted the metrics for 190 companies. Most of this information is hard to find, unavailable, incorrect, misleading, and would takes weeks to compile, but Gemini cuts this time down drastically, helping us make this app as accessible and easy to use as possible by people concerned with sustainability and corporate responsibility.

In addition to integrating Gemini into the app to expedite the extraction process, we utilized prompt engineering to ask Gemini for reliable sources on the internet to provide third-party estimates in addition to our own to verify company self-reporting.

We also integrated Gemini to interpret the output. Manually, we can only rank companies against each other. But with Gemini, it juxtaposes the company’s self-promotion regarding sustainability with its actual sustainability score. Additionally, it suggests economic ramifications such as investor interest due to impact from sustainability, and discusses the possible legal risk of the environmental impact.

Combining Gemini with deterministic analysis is empowering.

*** Description:
What it does

emotely helps users lead a more successful, grateful, and reflective life through guided journaling. The Gemini API powers the new emotely Journaling Assistant, a personalized chatbot designed to make journaling engaging and enjoyable. By accessing user information like name, language, and previous journal entries, the assistant tailors each session to the user, asking questions about their day, offering encouragement, and remembering personal details to create a meaningful experience. We've updated emotely with Accessibility in mind. Leveraging Flutter’s Accessibility features, we’ve ensured that the assistant is accessible to as many people as possible, enabling more users to establish a consistent journaling routine and benefit from regular gratitude and reflection exercises.

While our calculations indicate that the current carbon footprint of the emotely Journaling Assistant is higher than traditional pen-and-paper journaling due to LLM energy demands, it remains significantly more sustainable than in-person assistance. We are confident that as the efficiency of Gemini models continues to improve, our assistant will become even more environmentally friendly, ultimately surpassing classic journaling in sustainability.

When an artist uploads a tattoo on our app, the Gemini API automatically generates detailed summaries of the artwork, capturing its style, content and position. The AI generated descriptions then make it easier for users to filter and explore tattoos they like. This allows artists to attract clients that match their style, ensuring that both parties are satisfied with the final outcome.

The app ultimately creates a more fulfilling experience for users by helping them connect with artists they relate too.

Lumo Reading is a personalized reading platform that teaches children how to read in a faster, more personalized, and more engaging manner. It leverages the Gemini API in order to power its story creation engine, where the child can choose what character and location they want the story to be in, and have Gemini handle the rest. After the story is created, the child can read it out loud to Lumo, and Lumo then uses Gemini, other APIs, and its own algorithm in order to generate high quality feedback for the child. While doing this, it is also creating a custom reading profile for the child in the backend. This profile understands a child's ability to read, including specific nuances like words and phonemes the child may be having trouble pronouncing. Using this reading profile, Gemini can be more informed in its story creating process, making sure to emphasize sounds and syllables that the child struggles with, significantly improving the speed of their literacy improving due to this targeted learning. The difficulty of the stories will increase over time, as will the validity of the reading profile, creating a personalized and adaptive reading learning experience like never before, all powered by Gemini.

- ABSTRACT: This web app forecasts fruit diseases using real-time weather data.

*** Description:
What it does

Predict, Protect, Prosper: This web app is built to forecast plant diseases by analyzing weather conditions, enabling growers to take timely action and safeguard their crops.

Studies published in Nature and other scientific journals reveal that growers worldwide lose an average of 10 to 23 percent of their crops annually to fungal infections, despite the extensive use of fungicides.

Our goal with this tool is to predict upcoming fruit diseases and assist farmers in their defense strategies. To build this tool, we compiled a comprehensive Fruit Disease Names dataset, targeting common diseases in apples, apricots, cherries, grapes, peaches, and pears. Utilizing Google AI Studio with Gemini 1.5, we generated detailed disease parameters, which were stored in a Fruit Disease Dataset. This dataset forms the backbone of the app's predictive capabilities.

To start using the app, you'll need your own OpenWeather API key, which you can obtain for free by registering at OpenWeatherMap. With this key, our app can retrieve real-time weather data specific to your location, analyze the conditions, and forecast potential fruit diseases based on the generated disease dataset. This empowers farmers to proactively manage crop health, optimize yields, and minimize losses.

*** Description:
What it does

In the Journey Hub App, we harness the unique capabilities of the Gemini API, specifically the Gemini Pro model, to conduct highly precise, metropolitan area-specific searches. When a user submits a request via the Flutter app, Firestore is immediately updated with their prompt. We then employ a vector index in Firestore, containing embeddings and associated intents, to perform a nearest neighbor search. This process identifies the user's intent, such as seeking cooling centers or medical help, by matching it with predefined intents within the app.

Gemini’s standout feature is its ability to deliver highly localized searches. Once the user's intent is identified, Gemini performs a focused, location-specific search within the user's metropolitan area, retrieving relevant data like cooling centers or medical facilities. This ensures that users receive timely, context-specific information tailored precisely to their geographic location.

The data retrieved through Gemini is then formatted using the Instructor Python library to ensure clarity and relevance before being presented to the user. This capability not only provides immediate, location-based assistance but also allows for ongoing refinement. As users provide feedback, we will continuously update the intent vectors to enhance the accuracy and relevance of future searches, making the app smarter and more responsive over time.

The app allows users to create and manage events, connect with friends, and engage in meaningful conversations within a user-friendly interface. The app provides location suggestions, event notifications, and real-time chat functionality, all powered by advanced AI capabilities.

The Gemini API is deeply integrated into the app to enhance the user experience. For event creation, users can simply type in prompts like "I want to go hiking in Fremont," and Gemini suggests relevant locations with accurate addresses using Google Maps API. This feature simplifies the process of choosing a venue, making it easier for users to plan their events.

In chat, Gemini acts as an assistant, providing quick responses to user queries related to the event, such as weather conditions, best travel routes, or even generating a trip plan. The AI assistant ensures that users have all the necessary information at their fingertips, making event coordination smoother.

Additionally, the Gemini API is used to scan receipts and automatically extract details like item names, quantities, and prices. This helps users quickly split costs among event participants, streamlining the post-event settlement process.

"Join Me" uses Gemini API to streamline socializing and event planning, letting users focus on connecting with friends and creating memorable experiences.

In the Question input box enter which topic you want to take the test and select how many questions you want. Then click on "Take Test" then the app will make an api call to the Gemini with the topic and number of questions. API will use the model "gemini-1.5-flash" and type as "json" ie, generationConfig: GenerationConfig(responseMimeType: 'application/json'. App will make a request to the Gemini model with number of question, topic and the question model then Gemini will respond with the questions in json format. That json format will be used as the test. The prompt used for getting questions from the model:
prompt: 'Give $_selectedValue ${_questionsController.text} questions and options with answers in json with format $kFormat and different data on each time'
where _selectedValue is the value selected by the user and _questionController.text is the topic entered by the user and kFormat is the json format defined developer(me).
Without Gemini to achieve this we need to setup a backend with database and server and api calls but with Gemini we don't need any of that.
This just a demo for what we can do with Gemini, Any app which needs to get data from backend can be replaced with Gemini (we need to fine tune model according to our need).

What it does

My application is actually a Forest Fire Detection System called Project FFDS. It uses different technologies from Google, specifically from Google Clouds, such as Functions, Firestore, Cloud Storage, the Gemini API and Angular. Furthermore, the idea is for the application to become open-source, as I greatly value everyone's contribution. The system is based on the use of a network of sensor nodes made with Arduinos. The sensor nodes are equipped with temperature sensors, a camera, a carbon dioxide sensor, a geolocation module and a transceiver. Currently, there are two types of devices in this network: the sensor nodes and the end-transmission gateways (I plan to introduce repeaters to extend the range even further). The end-gateways are equipped with a 4G module, which enables communication with the cloud over the HTTP protocol. The data captured by the sensor nodes are propagated by the gateways and then stored in a document database (Firestore). The transmission can be divided into two parts, simple data transmission and image transmission. In the image transmission, the images are broken down, sent and reassembled in the cloud in a storage directory. These same images are linked to the records made in the first stage (simple data). The images, once complete, generate a call to a Python function from Clouds Function called analyzeImage that detects the presence or absence of fire in the images, storing this result later in the record of the respective document.

Stoqs is a financial insights and research platform with a unique generative experience. The application offers a beautiful UI and a streamlined UX, allowing users to conduct financial research in multiple threads or use specific companies or news as context for a conversation. We use LLMs as agents to collect, collate and summarize high quality data beyond general search or crawling. Agents decompose queries and plan retrieval from trusted sources - whether it's analyses, raw stats or visualizations. Using Retrieval Augmented Generation indexed SEC Filings, news and earning call transcripts, you get almost insider-level information for your queries.
We adopted an approach to query decomposition specifically for the financial domain. Financial queries typically exhibit interdependencies that require careful planning and resolution. Our decomposition strategy involves a central orchestrator called the Answer & Visual Planner which focuses on breaking down queries into dependent and independent sub-queries, but also on preemptively addressing complex visual requirements. The system iteratively resolves downstream dependencies, processing each sub-query until all dependencies are fully resolved. Upon completion, the orchestrator aggregates the results, collating all textual and visual elements. Our response module synthesizes the information into a coherent output.
Gemini powers our product by allowing us to work with a wide variety of data streams and large context windows.

- ABSTRACT: Scan invoices by using phone’s camera, describe and export to Excel!

*** Description:
What it does

Artificial intelligence supported invoice reading application. It categorizes and saves them on a company basis according to the information in the invoice. It can analyze the impact of the products in the invoices on the person and the environment and can save time on financial transactions by taking Excel output. It also creates a monthly summary table based on the content of the invoices.

The invoice processing process is time-consuming, costly, erroneous, and tedious for both businesses and consumers. This leads to wasted time, money, resources, and environmental pollution. The goal is to create an artificial intelligence-supported invoice reading application that can automatically read, categorize, save, and analyze invoices. The solution will target businesses, accountants, and consumers who deal with invoices regularly.

Flutter was used on the application side. This ensured a very fast development process. OpenCV was used to detect the invoices on the camera and Google Image-to-Text ML Kit was used to read the text on the invoices. The texts here were parsed with Regex. Gemini was used in AI mode. In this way, an extra mode was added to analyse and read the invoices. In this way, the user will always be able to read the invoice by using AI mode when he wants higher accuracy and Legacy mode when he does not have internet.

RosettAI's true innovation lies in its ability to synthesize translations from diverse sources, even when these sources are written in different languages. By leveraging Gemini’s industry-leading context window size, advanced reasoning capabilities, and exceptional multilingual support, RosettAI can effectively process a wide variety of data to generate accurate translations, helping to safeguard languages from extinction.

Our solution is pivotal for languages like "Ghomala" spoken in Central Africa (presented in the demo), for which existing documents are rare, often use different glyphs and may be linked with translations in English or French or German (languages which ruled over the area consecutively). This demonstrates the system’s ability to cohesively translate even when concepts are distributed among different languages.

The interface is user-friendly, allowing easy comparison of multiple source texts while providing visual cues for uncertain translations. Moreover, RosettAI’s responsive design ensures accessibility across devices, ensuring a broad reach.

*** Description:
What it does

Anxiety disorders, affecting 33.7% globally (Stein & Stein, 2008), are a widespread issue. Recognizing this issue, our app aims to support those with social anxiety by using AI to create a virtual self. It fosters a safe space to build confidence and manage social situations effectively.
MAI enables users to create a highly accurate digital replica of themselves. We’ve developed this replica with near-perfect accuracy, replicating language use, communication style, and response timing, making interactions feel natural and smooth. Using the Gemini API, these replicas engage in complex conversations, understand advanced contexts, and provide precise, personalized responses, making interactions feel natural and intimate. Unlike traditional chatbots, our app utilizes prompt engineering and one-shot learning to create a long-term memory system that adapts to the user’s personality. MAI’s advanced algorithms assess user compatibility through communication styles, preferences, and values. By combining traditional algorithms with NLP techniques like LIWC and vector similarity, MAI fosters genuine connections. The system refines match parameters by tracking conversation volumes and user behavior. Once high compatibility is reached, users can smoothly transition from virtual to real-life interactions, helping those with social anxiety build confidence.
We also use Firebase to track user interactions, tailors app experiences, and enables dynamic updates for personalized use.

What it does

This app records information about your friends and allows you to retrieve it via chat.

Do you ever forget what you talked about with your friends?
The details of those conversations are saved and saved in JSON format using GeminiAPI.

Then you ask a question in the chat, get your friend's information using RAG, and reply using GeminiAPI.

One clever feature is that the chat content is also first categorized into four patterns using GeminiAPI.

The method of internally obtaining data changes for each pattern.
The obtained information is then converted into text using GeminiAPI and replied to.

Many people save RAG data in advance before using it, but this method allows the data to be updated dynamically, expanding the possibilities for future use.

Our app allows kids to assemble SCABO cardboard toys with 3D detailed instructions. Then, children can turn the cardboard toys into smart toys in AR with Gemini AI capabilities. Our app can detect and track 3D position of cardboard toys in realtime with our own 3D computer vision algorithm. We utilize Gemini 1.5 Pro capabilities including vision and text completion to become AI assistant for children in learning scientific subjects. Our 3D inventory system including more than 500 simulations in human anatomy, mechanics, and space models. We designed the 3D simulations by texturing the 3D models with different color for different parts of scientific objects to prevent AI-hallucination. Gemini AI recognizes the virtual simulations better and give better explanations for kids. Furthermore, we use the Gemini API to detect object in the scientific scenes. Given the image including the foreground 3D virtual models or real artifact and a question from users such as "Where is differential gear", Gemini AI object detection can detect 2D position of the parts. Then, we have 3D mapping algorithm to map the 2D position into the scientific object. Lastly, we encourage children to reuse their existing plastic toys in the AR toy stories mode. Gemini API is used to generate the sci-fi stories between virtual scientists and the plastic toy. Children can both learn and talk with virtual 3D simulations or their own toys in scientific scope. All 3D simulations are free & on the fly.

*** Description:
What it does

The app allows users to converse with Gemini as if they were in an Applied Behavioural Therapy session for individuals with autism to improve their social skills and be monitored for repetitive/harmful behaviours. The topics of conversation and behaviours exhibited are stored to later be reviewed by friends, family, or therapists to guide the individual’s treatment plans. Since therapy sessions tend to be expensive and infrequent, this application could help struggling families support family members with autism.
The conversational format is achieved thanks to Gemini’s unique ability to evaluate both visual and audio data. During the conversation, image frames and audio files are uploaded to the Gemini API. Gemini evaluates the frames and audio together, allowing Gemini to evaluate and respond to physical and auditory actions of the individual such as facial expressions, vocal inflections, pronunciation, and more. For example, Gemini can make note of a harmful behaviour (hitting oneself) and also for how many frames it occurred for. Over time, progress can be evaluated by how much a behaviour is reduced, measured by having the behaviour occur over less frames (time).
On Firebase, the chat transcripts and noted behaviours are stored for each session. Upon request, the session data can be provided to Gemini to summarize for parents or therapists. This helps bring the individuals activities to the attention of others who could use the information to help them better.

- ABSTRACT: CHANGE THE BOOKS INTO EASY ENGLISH VERSION (without its flow)

*** Description:
What it does

My app simplifies difficult text in PDF books, making it easier to read for non-native English speakers. The app is designed to help users understand complex language and improve their vocabulary by breaking down hard words and sentences into simpler English.

Here's how it works:

1.Text Extraction: The app uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from PDF files. This allows it to process books that are in scanned or image formats.

2.Simplifying Text: The core feature of the app involves using the Google Gemini API. After extracting the text, the app sends it to the Gemini API, which rephrases complex sentences and identifies difficult words.

3.Replacement and Output: The app uses regular expressions to extract and replace difficult words with simpler definitions provided by the API. Users can choose between two modes: Beginner and Intermediate. The Beginner mode simplifies the text more thoroughly, while the Intermediate mode provides more challenging vocabulary to help users gradually improve their English skills.

4.Results: Finally, the app generates a text file with the simplified content, making it easier to read and understand. This output can be a valuable tool for learners who struggle with advanced English texts.

By integrating the Gemini API, the app not only simplifies language but also customizes the learning experience based on the user’s English proficiency level.

Image Analysis: Once the photo is taken, it is sent to the Gemini API, which analyzes the image and generates a description of its contents.

Text-to-Speech: The description returned by the Gemini API is read aloud to the user through a text-to-speech feature, allowing them to understand what is in the photo.

Purpose:
This app is a special tool created to assist blind individuals, helping them navigate and comprehend their surroundings in a new way. My intention is to provide meaningful support to those who can benefit from it, offering them a new form of interaction with the world around them.

It acts as a concept button for the Google Maps, offering a feature that is only applicable to those who is present at the place.

How I used the Gemini API:

- Created my tuned model with structured prompt. Input is about a subject and output is the then-and-now summary of the situation of the subject. The "then" refers to the period of April 30th, 1975 when the Saigon administration fell and marked the end of The Vietnam War.

- The subject can be something like "children", "adults", "markets", "political voices around the world towards the war", "the contemporary president of the U.S.", "cars", or "jobs", ... The output has to give insights into the subject and if applicable, the difference about the subject between Vietnam and the U.S. I use GPT-4o to generate the training data (Yes, I did double check some of it).

- Using the tuned model: I set the system instruction as "You have insights into the war from the perspectives of a diplomat, a soldier, a normal Vietnamese, and a normal American. You cherish the past that the two nations share and look forward to the future". Unfortunately, I haven't finished completely.

What it does

The Power of Multi-Model Collaboration:
Imagine a chatbot where you can start a conversation with Gemini, and then seamlessly switch over to ChatGPT or Llama or another language model, who can pick up the thread and continue the conversation based on the previous model's understanding. This collaborative approach offers several exciting possibilities:
Contextual Understanding: Each model can build upon the context established by the previous one. This allows for richer conversations where the chatbot's memory and understanding of the conversation flow consistently, even as you switch models.
Diverse Perspectives: Switching models lets you tap into different AI personalities and approaches. One model might be better at creative writing, while another might excel at factual information. By combining them, your app could offer a more rounded and insightful response.
Improved Accuracy: By utilizing multiple models, the app could potentially overcome the limitations of any one model, leading to more accurate and reliable information.
Technical Considerations:
Model Communication: You'll need a way to smoothly transfer the conversation's context from one model to the next. This requires clever technical solutions to ensure a seamless handover.
Model Consistency: Ensuring that the models respond in a consistent manner, even with different personalities, is a challenge. It will require careful training and tuning to minimize inconsistencies.

Story Generation: Once a user selects a story type, the app sends a request to the Gemini API to generate the complete story. The prompt includes details about the chosen genre and story type, ensuring that the generated content is aligned with user preferences.

Content Formatting: The API returns the story in a JSON format. We then process this JSON response to extract the story title and content. The story is formatted into paragraphs with appropriate punctuation to enhance readability and facilitate text-to-speech (TTS) functionality.

Error Handling and Duplication Prevention: We handle potential errors and ensure that the generated content is unique. If the API response contains errors or duplicates, we retry the request or fetch new suggestions to provide fresh and engaging content.

The Gemini API's advanced language model enables us to offer a diverse range of stories, ensuring that users receive creative and unique narratives every time they interact with our app.

What it does

The app is a choose your own adventure game designed to teach players about climate change and how to reduce their effects on it. The details of the story’s main characters can be edited to generate a personalized and compelling experience. The player and Gemini then collaborate to write a short story of three chapters with about 10 parts. The app is built for Flutter Web. Gemini 1.5 Pro is using an Open API Schema to structure the output. Gemini generates parts of the story along with 2 choices. This is processed into objects using several models and formatted for display. The player chooses one of them which is sent back to Gemini to continue the narrative along with further guidance on how to continue the story.
The project is aimed at all adults 18 and over across the globe who have internet access. According to a report by the UN, with current policies in place, by the end of this century we will experience a temperature increase of 2.5+ degrees celsius. This will be catastrophic for all life on earth. During game play a series of actions that can be taken by the player are revealed. These can be added to a goals list saved to Firestore to be completed at a later time. Setting and planning goals is known to be a key factor in success. The app also mentions tips that have been found to be effective in the psychology of goal setting to help the player develop a strategy to achieve these goals. This is an important step in tackling the problem to reduce emissions.

Digital technology plays an important role in accessibility and participation in modern society. However, when access to digital technology is disproportionate or limited, some people may have difficulty enjoying the benefits of information and technology. This may violate the core values of participatory democracy and can hinder social integration. requires technical solutions to improve access to public services and information. Allaw is a web service platform developed to solve problems in current assembly agenda search and analysis systems and to improve access and understanding of the legislative process. Compared to existing businesses, the Allaw service has a significant difference in the search and utilization of information. Existing businesses have simple search functions that make it possible to search for specific words. Even if you search for it, it is difficult to summarize the contents on your own. However, Allaw can provides a function to clearly understand the contents of the bill based on the contents of the bill analyzed by the Gemini. The accuracy of information is of utmost importance to the search system. To alleviate the "Hallucination" phenomenon, which is one of the most chronic and fatal problems of Generative AI technology, we have designed Prompt engineering to prioritize searching for internal information based on RAG (Retrieval-Augusted Generation), and to provide responses indicating the source when using external information.

*** Description:
What it does

AlphaFit is a workout app for beginners. It uses Gemini API in different ways
- develop personalized workout programs
- adjust difficulty
- on-demand help & support
- check exercise form
- mental-agility word games while recovering between sets

During setup, Gemini helps build a custom workout program tailored to the user’s lifestyle, fitness, available equipment, and constraints like disability/injury. This gives personalized, clear and achievable goals to get started. While exercising, the Gemini-powered helper provides contextual support about exercises and equipment. Gemini’s multimodal AI analyzes the user’s form in context of the exercise. This empowers the user to proceed with confidence, and ensures they feel supported throughout with access to information on demand. Emphasis is given to inter-set recovery time which is often overlooked. Despite its positive effects (reduced soreness, better results), waiting between sets can be boring and lacks the feeling of participation. Gemini’s command on natural language is leveraged to craft thematic word games, which actively engage the user's mental skills while their muscles get the right time to recover. Gemini API powers word selection and accompanying cryptic clues. A motivation loop is created by awarding play tokens for completed sets, as well as for additional activity (information sourced from Health Connect). Gemini is further utilized to adjust the workout difficulty level as the user’s fitness improves.

*** Description:
What it does

Genesis is a causal analysis chatbot. Through the use of zero-shot prompting, I was able to combine 7 different "Gemini models" into one platform.

The user will first query the chatbot and then review the causal variables stemming from this event. The chatbot will respond with 3causes and 3 effects. This enables personal discovery and analysis through causal inferencing.

If the user wants to dive into a particular area, we provide 6 other experts to re-query their request. These 6 experts are also Zero-shot prompts. The 6 experts are Local, Municipal, National, Global, Economical and Ecological. Each prompt has a different lens and language type. For example, the local expert will respond with language befitting a friend while the global expert will respond with language befitting a president.

In terms of the Gemini API, I primarily used the chat-session and google ai Studio.

This provides almost a 3rd party review of the tone of he writing. Gemini helped me develop a unique encryption factor to make sure the journal is private, There are also many hidden gems to discuss further when the time is right.

Hence, we developed a website designed to evaluate and identify the emotions of adolescents. We believe that accurately understanding our emotions is essential for managing them effectively.
We incorporated Gemini AI to enhance the accuracy and quality of our website. Our website functions similarly to a psychological assessment, guiding users through a series of scientifically-backed questions based on the emotional wheel.
Users can classify their feelings into one of seven emotional categories. Once a category is selected, our AI generates tailored questions specific to that emotion. Participants will encounter ten questions, although they can choose to conclude the assessment early if they prefer.
On the result page, there are 41 hand-drawn characters that represent different emotions. Additionally, inspirational quotes are included to provide meaningful takeaways after the assessment. For those who wish to share their experience, there is also an option to download the results page, making it easy to share on social media. This version maintains the original message while improving readability and engagement.

- TITLE: Traffic_Complaint_System  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Complaint against traffic rules violators online.

*** Description:
What it does

Basic idea of my project was to ease the process of complaining traffic violation in my country, as you maybe aware that most of the streets and cities in bangladesh doesn't have enough traffic police or traffic lights, and you see a vehicle committing crime, violating traffic rules you can't even complaint except reaching out to the nearest police station or police box. Now what I've implemented is that you take pictures of the vehicle, take note of the vehicle number and submit an online application from your phone or any device able to access the web. Where gemini api is being used?
Well there is two methods for submitting a complaint, one you write out manually, provide images and fill all the details, then submit.
Another, you just need to upload the vehicle violation image, if vehicle number and location is not identified from the given image, you can submit them just like a normal chat with your friend or provide another image containing vehicle number or with more information of the violation that the vehicle is making.
Gemini is playing a key role here to ease the process of complaining just by using a mere picture. Now it has a huge future scope, for example we can implement a live monitoring system using camera on the street for violation and complaint or fine the vehicle owner by using vehicle number automatically just like Dubai. But thats a long way to go. I'm thinking of current state in my country.

Readily is an app designed to provide personalized therapy for you and your loved ones. The target audience for my app includes people with special needs and their caretakers who lack immediate access to personalized therapy due to geography, cost, or bureaucracy. This could only be made possible by the effectiveness and cost efficiency of Generative AI.

In Readily, users can select or create roadmaps that suit their specific needs and track their personalized therapy progress. Google’s Gen AI model Gemini-1.5-Pro serves as the backbone of my app, from creating specialized roadmaps with detailed modules and instructions to generating a specialized therapy for each user. The app also utilizes Google OAuth2 and is built using React and TypeScript, with MongoDB as the database.

The biggest challenge I've faced is verifying the quality of AI-generated content, as accessing credible medical resources is costly and risks copyright infringement. While I'm pleased with the app’s progress, I'm hesitant to release it publicly due to the potential for misinformation. Creating a credible medical library alone is nearly an impossible mission for one person, but I hope that the Google team can build on this foundation to make personalized therapy more accessible and help narrow the socioeconomic gap in healthcare.

*** Description:
What it does

MoodMind is an emotion detection system integrated with personalized recommendations based on the detected emotions. The system uses `cv2` (OpenCV) for capturing video frames and `DeepFace` for emotion analysis.

Based on the detected emotion, the Gemini API is called to generate a recommendation. The API call requests a short, five-word recommendation tailored to the specific emotion. The recommendations are dynamically generated for each detected emotion: happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprise, fear, and disgust.

The captured video frame is displayed with overlay text showing the user's name, age, detected emotion, and the corresponding recommendation from the Gemini API. The video feed updates in real-time, continuously analyzing and providing recommendations until the user decides to quit the session by closing the video feed.

The Gemini model (`gemini-1.5-flash`) is initialized to handle the content generation. For each detected emotion, the model's `generate_content` method is called with a prompt to generate a short recommendation. The generated text is then displayed on the video feed.

Additionally, the system stores user data, including name, age, detected emotion, and recommendation, in Firebase Firestore. The video feed updates every 10 seconds, capturing the current frame, analyzing the emotion, generating a recommendation, and storing the data in Firestore.

- ABSTRACT: Wisdom and Tarot fortune-telling led by Gemini.

*** Description:
What it does

Using Gemini, which is good at interpretation and advice, I created a tarot fortune-telling app that will comfort people's weary mind due to worries. I took care to create the feeling of actually drawing a card by using a little animation and TTS.
There are two representative functions: wisdom cards and tarot cards. Wisdom Card is a function that encourages people to wisely change their perspective on the current situation by choosing one of 10 wise saying cards randomly selected by Gemini. Tarot cards can be used when people need more specific advice and comfort, rather than simply resolving their concerns.
Gemini was used to directly analyze responses by specifying specific roles and syntactic structures. In the Tarot card, She is instructed to analyze the question and choose the type of spread for herself. We directly implemented the UI that places cards according to the response, and the selected cards were passed to Gemini as a list and asked to be interpreted.
All of Gemini's conversation history can be heard as a sound because of using TextToSpeech, and can be turned on and off at any time with the speaker button in the upper right corner. I used chat history so that she could briefly say hello when I visited again.

The app still lacks many things, such as language support and fixed Gemini responses. I would consider it an honor just to successfully submit to the competition.

*** Description:
What it does

Eco Picker is an innovative app that turns cleaning up your surroundings into a fun game. Users earn points for collecting different types of trash, with higher scores awarded for more harmful waste. This motivates users to clean up their surroundings while checking their ranking within Eco Picker against other users to enjoy a game-like experience while contributing to the environment.

When a user takes a photo of the garbage they’ve collected, the app uses the Gemini API to identify the item and categorize it into one of six types: plastic, metal, glass, cardboard/paper, food scraps, and others. This helps users understand the environmental impact of their actions.

Eco Picker also features news, events, and educational content on recycling and environmental protection, generated by the Gemini API. While some AI-generated content may still be fabricated, we display it with the expectation that future Gemini API updates will improve accuracy.

Additionally, the Google Maps API is integrated to track and visualize the locations of collected trash, with each item pinned on the map, creating a visual record of users' positive impact.

*** Description:
What it does

According to Google, there are over 14 billion publicly viewable videos on YouTube; yet only a small fraction of them can be accessed by people with visual impairments. According to the WHO, at least 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from a near or distance vision impairment, preventing them from fully experiencing the vast repository of video content on the world’s leading video platforms.

Audio description is a longstanding practice in TV and film, and considered a solution to allow the blind and visually impaired community to consume and enjoy video based content... But the process of audio describing videos is time and cost-prohibitive, preventing audio descriptions from reaching the masses via independently created web-based videos.

Enter ViddyScribe: a web platform where video creators can upload their videos and quickly receive them back fully audio-described, so that the videos can be shared with and enjoyed by the blind community.

The Gemini API is used to analyze the user’s uploaded video and generate contextually-aware timestamped audio descriptions for every meaningful section of the video. Then, the audio descriptions are converted into speech and placed at the timestamps, while we insert freeze frames, smooth audio transitions, and generated background audio to aid in creating a pleasant listening experience.

Created by two volunteers for the blind with backgrounds in videography and impactful solutions, ViddyScribe aims to make all videos truly inclusive.

The app takes input of an image of a medical document containing a disease and/or treatment, it extracts this information using Gemini's vision capabilities and then generates detailed information with Gemini in non medical terms to give, for the disease: cause, signs and symptoms, treatment and prevention and for the treatment: generic name, indications, mechanism of action, side effects and contraindications. This information is then presented back to the user.

We are focusing on images to preserve the information as obtained from the attending health personnel and also increase accessibility to people who can't read but can use a smartphone. Our primary target are communities still using paper medical records, specifically Uganda since we know there is need there.

Built to be an add-on to visiting a doctor, in case the patient wants to find more information about the disease and/or treatment and not intended in anyway to replace the clinician.

We acknowledge the limitations of the application of LLMs in healthcare (especially hallucinations in both text and OCR work), and clearly state these on all application webpages except the landing page.

Although Gemini 1.5 Pro is more accurate in OCR work, since we're serving areas that can't pay for the service, it's more sustainable to use 1.5 Flash although it has shown reduced accuracy, as expected. We are optimistic that if Gemini continues to improve as has been the trend, Ninx will also improve automatically.

Vitalis revolutionizes personalized healthcare by integrating food, exercise, and overall wellbeing tracking into a single, comprehensive platform. Leveraging Gemini, Google’s advanced multi-modal AI, Vitalis allows users to effortlessly log their health data using video, audio, or text inputs, dramatically reducing the burden of manual entry. With tailored meal and exercise recommendations based on individual goals and historical data, Vitalis offers a holistic approach to wellness that simplifies health tracking, making it more accurate, engaging, and user-friendly.

Traditional food and exercise trackers often lack the personalized guidance users need, requiring time-consuming manual entry that can lead to inaccuracies, particularly with portion sizes and exercise intensity. Moreover, these apps often fail to offer tailored suggestions, such as specific meal plans or workouts aligned with individual fitness goals, making it harder for users to reach their desired outcomes.

Gemini’s advanced capabilities make Vitalis a superior solution, ensuring high accuracy in food and exercise logging while addressing common challenges of manual data entry. By processing and analyzing long contexts, Gemini empowers Vitalis to offer personalized advice that considers the user’s entire health journey, rather than isolated data points. The result is a more informed and effective health management experience, enabling users to achieve their wellness goals with greater ease and precision.

The Express server communicates with another server developed using Flask. The Flask microservice handles data scraping, script generation for links using Gemini, and humanizing the script using Eleven Labs TTS. Both servers share a MongoDB database.

Gemini uses the scraped data and several other parameters, such as the time of day and mood, to generate a script for the link that should be spoken by the RJ. This script is then sent to the Eleven Labs TTS API to generate vocal data. The vocal data is processed to create a final link tailored specifically for the user.

*** Description:
What it does

Our prototype app is a dynamic, AI-driven detective RPG where players interrogate Gemini-powered characters. Unlike traditional games with scripted dialogue, our app embraces the inherent unpredictability of AI to create a unique and humorous experience.

We've utilized Gemini's language capabilities to let it interpret characters with distinct personalities and unexpected responses. By allowing players complete freedom in their interactions, we encourage a sense of discovery and humor as conversations unfold organically. To provide a structured foundation for this emergent gameplay, we've carefully crafted scenarios and characters, acting as a springboard for Gemini's improvisational skills.
This way Gemini becomes the game master, adhering to a small set of rules and working with the player to craft a tailored and unique experience.

To further enhance unpredictability, our Gemini characters are free to engage in character to character dialogue, adding an extra layer of complexity and surprise to player interactions.

This approach results in a game that's both engaging and unpredictable, offering endless replayability and the potential for truly unexpected moments.

- TITLE: Simón  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Multimodal toy robot that function-calls generated behaviors

*** Description:
What it does

Simón tries to imitate humans, like the game of "Simon says". First a human will record a short video, image, or audio via a Chrome Gradio Python app on a touchscreen display. The Gemini API uploads this media input and gets a text description of the scene and any humans. The text description is then prompt-engineered such that Gemini function-calling chooses the best possible robot behavior function out of a couple dozen candidates. Robot behavior functions are hand-crafted, but new novel behaviors can also be generated with Gemini (code generation) using a script. We hosted a YouTube livestream instructing developers on how they can create their own robot behavior functions. Simón is made of foam, socks, and tape and runs on a Raspberry Pi with a camera, USB microphone and speakers, three hobby servos, two LED eyes, and a touchscreen display. All code is open sourced and we provide a full Build Guide with install instructions and a BOM. We provide a helper script that lets developers ask questions about Simón to a Gemini chat instance, pre-populating with relevant context. All code is written in Python and we use the async module to run behavior functions and Gemini API calls in parallel. The code design is modular for easy customizability and extendability. Our hope is that developers can use Simón as a launching point to build their own robotics projects that use the Gemini API.

*** Description:
What it does

GlowAlarm is a new mobile app developed for the deaf and hard of hearing.It was created to overcome the limitations of existing emergency alert systems. The core of GlowAlarm is to convert information that cannot be heard into visual signals. This allows users with hearing difficulties to quickly respond to emergency situations without missing critical information.

GlowAlarm works in conjunction with smart light bulbs. When an emergency occurs, GlowAlarm immediately controls the connected smart bulbs. The bulbs emit light in various colors and flashing patterns depending on the severity and type of the situation. For example, rapid red flashes signal immediate danger, while slow yellow blinks indicate caution.

GlowAlarm's key function is prioritizing disaster alerts and controlling bulbs accordingly. It distinguishes between non-urgent notifications like heat advisories and life-threatening alerts like earthquake warnings. We use Gemini API, an LLM, to automate this complex analysis and risk classification.

We prioritized recall over precision, as detecting all dangerous situations is crucial in safety-critical contexts. Recall measures how comprehensively actual dangers are detected. Through continuous prompt optimization with the Gemini API, we maximized recall, accepting cases where lower-level incidents might be classified as higher-level ones to ensure optimal safety. This approach minimizes the risk of missing any dangerous situations that could threaten user safety.

*** Description:
What it does

Read Quest is an innovative Chrome extension designed to enhance productivity and comprehension while reading blogs. The extension utilizes a custom API, developed with Node.js and hosted on Azure, to generate interactive multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the blog content.

Here’s how it works: when a user navigates to a blog page, the extension sends some of the content of the current page as a prompt to our API. This API then interacts with the Gemini API to generate relevant MCQs tailored to the content of the blog. The generated questions and answer options are returned in a JSON format.

Once the JSON data is received, the extension renders the questions and options directly in the user interface, allowing users to select their answers. After submitting their choices, the extension evaluates the responses, compares them with the correct answers, and provides immediate feedback by highlighting correct answers in green and incorrect ones in red. The user’s score is then displayed at the bottom of the quiz.

By integrating the Gemini API, Read Quest ensures that the quizzes are contextually accurate and directly related to the blog content. This process helps users assess their comprehension of the material, stay focused, and retain information more effectively, ultimately enhancing their reading experience and productivity.

*** Description:
What it does

The application receives sound signals through the user's voice commands and analyzes them using the Google Gemini API to convert these voice commands into actions. These commands can vary. They can be commands to open a specific application and browse a specific website on the Internet. I confirm that the application can handle all of these complex tasks efficiently. Moving to the specifications, it is achieved by the integration of advanced voice recognition technology to capture the voice and convert it into text then integrating text to speech technology that does the opposite process, which allows users to have a comfortable experience without the need to use a keyboard. Using the Google Gemini API, the application can provide quick and accurate responses, which enhances the user experience. Now, it's time to explain what are the steps I followed to implement the idea. After coming up with the idea, I started to think about the tools that I would probably use, and then I started to implement the project. After that, I started working on the application of it. The first problem that I faced was that there was a problem with downloading the Python program. After some research, I found a solution to this problem through Google. This is the code that I have collected through different libraries onlines. Each library's code performs a specific function. After we open the terminal and wait for a few seconds, then we will say the word "Open", and the program is going to open.

- ABSTRACT: Use natural language to buy crypto instantly for the first time ever.

*** Description:
What it does

ChainATM is an A.I. model that fulfills buy orders on chain with the help of Google Gemini 1.5 Pro, Chainlink Functions and the PayPal SDK. A smart contract is deployed on Ethereum, ready to be triggered after the fiat payment is done with PayPal. Chainlink basically brings the internet into a smart contract which normally work in kind of silos by allowing API Requests to any source outside. For the first time ever, you can buy USDC with a simple text message. It takes about 90 seconds to confirm two transactions on chain until the money is released from the contract to the given recipient address.

The main use-case of the Gemini API was to create a buddy-like persona with restrictions on how to behave. We figured out that structured prompts work much better instead of freeform prompts. The model uses a given context (crypto transaction expert specializing in fiat to crypto conversions), behavior (soft-skills: friendly, talking like a long-known friend) and has two main tasks to accomplish. 1 - Extract user input and 2 - check the given recipient address for correctness. Correctness means that the given address starts with '0x' followed by 40 characters. The model will also be a consultant to help the normie user from web2 to onboard as smooth as possible by making recommendations regarding wallets.

*** Description:
What it does

Kidframe allows parents and guardians to curate YouTube videos that are safe for children using natural language. Current measures or tools for curation involve controls that are not effective and not tailored to the specific needs of parents or guardians. Often, these current tools are simple control filters that evaluate videos by matching information provided by the video's creator. However, the effectiveness of these simple filter controls is often limited by the availability and quality of information declared by the creator. This ineffectiveness may also be compounded by the video platform's ability to utilize such information for accurate filtering.

As such, Kidframe aims to address these issues using Gemini Flash to evaluate videos based on policies defined using natural language. With Kidframe, videos are now evaluated based on their actual content using Gemini Flash, and policies are defined using natural language that can be easily tailored to specific needs and requirements. By leveraging Gemini Flash's capabilities, Kidframe empowers parents and guardians with an easier and smarter way of curating videos for a safe and fun viewing experience for their kids.

What it does

Daakiya App is a streamlined courier service that connects travellers with individuals or entities requiring fast, affordable delivery of parcels across India. The problem we're addressing is the slow, expensive courier process. Our solution allows travellers to monetize their journeys by couriering items from one location to another. Users can send anything from medicines to documents anywhere in the country in the fastest way possible. The unique aspect of Daakiya is that it doesn't require separate driver/delivery app registration. Users can both send parcels and act as couriers within the same app, hence improving efficiency and convenience. We are using Google Gemini AI in the application at the below junctures:

1. Traveller's image validation (To verify that a real human is adding a travel)
2. While delivering the parcel, the traveller has to match the parcel image with the priviously uploaded image while picking up. We are using the google Gemini AI to validate this.
3. Our app highlights the carbon emissions saved when travelers deliver parcels, helping them understand the environmental benefits of their journeys. Through Google Gemini, we calculate and display the reduction in carbon footprint, turning each delivery into a step towards a greener planet.
4. We are using Google Gemini API's powerful feature to act it as a chatbot for our users. We have given the AI proper prompt which will help our users with some key app related information and queries.

We built AI interviewers that conduct realistic interviews. This would help practise and conduct interviews. Currently, its for SWE roles, so it mimics an interview for the same. Its not like a QA agent that asks you fixed questions on JD, but its more dynamic. We built a custom video meeting platform with integrated code editor. The AI interviewer not only asks question about SWE and resume but also throughly examines candidate's problem solving skills by asking several DSA questions (need to code the solution as well, if you get stuck no worries, interviewer will give you hint!).

We recently finished our first phase of beta testing with actual customers and the feedback was good. Just a couple week ago we launched our first public beta.

The product is currently live at https://cognatoai.com. If you need any help to setup or run the product or see it in action feel free to connect with me. We are not providing 1 microservice which is crucial to run the application.

We used a hierarchical multi agent approach to build this. We tested out several LLMs to power this but finally settled with Gemini 1.5 Flash, Gemini 1.0 Pro (tried Gemini 1.5. Pro which did give amazing results but its rate limit was too low) along with Llama family (on Groq). Yes! we used them all, we put large models (gemini 1.5 flash and llama 3 70) to reasoning cases (things like decision making) and generation was done by 1.0 pro and llama 3 8b, this helped us significantly reduce interview costs.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app simplifies the process of extracting and organizing data from invoices into Google Sheets.

Users simply input their desired data fields in the first row of each column in a Google Sheet. After uploading a PDF invoice, the app automatically converts it to PNG format and utilizes the Gemini API to accurately extract relevant data from the image.

The extracted data is then matched with the corresponding columns in the Google Sheet based on the user’s input. This allows users to easily organize, analyze, and manage invoice data without the need for manual entry.

We started out with invoice use cases only, but we are soon rolling out the ability to upload any kind of PDF and extract data from it.

*** Description:
What it does

ItinerAI is designed for travelers who want to explore new places without the hassle of extensive planning. It creates a complete itinerary for your chosen location, including hotels, check-in and check-out times, activities, and more! The app combines mathematical algorithms and the Gemini language model to tailor efficient trip plans to the user’s preferences.

Upon receiving trip details, our app retrieves hotels and activities from the Google Maps API based on location and budget. Activities that match the user's interests are scored and clustered using density-based spatial clustering, with K-means refinement if needed. Gemini AI fine-tunes these selections, ensuring they align with user preferences by analyzing the nature of the activities and reviews.

Hotels are then assigned to activity clusters based on proximity, using Euclidean distance calculations. Clusters are merged if hotels are nearby, reducing redundancy. Finally, Gemini AI integrates user preferences, trip duration, and logistics to create a detailed day-by-day plan. The output is a deeply nested JSON that includes reasoning and explanations, inspired by chain-of-thought techniques for better accuracy.

This is just the beginning. Future enhancements will include a five-axis analysis for improved activity and hotel selection, a conversational assistant for setting trip parameters, and tools for booking transport, making ItinerAI an all-in-one solution for travelers.

- TITLE: Exercise is all you Need  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Exercise to get in Size

*** Description:
What it does

This app is a fitness assistant app which helps in assisting users with their workout regime and it also gives suggestions on how the users can improve upon their workout.

This app has the functionality of three llm’s(gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro and gemini-1.0-pro) and users can select any one model from these and interact with the app wherein they can simply ask for suggestions regarding any type of exercise or they can also upload their workout video and ask for suggestions on how they can improve upon their workout. For the video functionality, the user can choose either gemini-1.5-flash or gemini-1.5-pro while gemini-1.0-pro supports text only input. We have also incorporated the temperature functionality of the llm in case the user wishes to get more creative suggestions.

To build this app we have used streamlit to host the web app and have used the gemini api in which we have taken support of the gemini-1.5-flash, gemini-1.5-pro and gemini-1.0-pro large language models to create the virtual fitness assistant buddy for our users. Each model gets its own set of system instructions on how to interact with the user and we have also ensured that when the user is interacting with a certain model the chat history is saved in the backend so that the model remains in-context and gives relevant answers to the user in successive api calls.

Gemini Radio is an innovative AI-powered platform designed to bridge the digital divide by transforming handwritten community inquiries into polished podcast episodes. In regions like Zambia, where internet access is limited, but postal mail and radio are widespread, Gemini Radio leverages these existing technologies to make vital knowledge accessible to remote communities.

The process is simple yet powerful. A staff member at a local radio station uses a web app on a regular phone to scan handwritten letters. The app then digitizes the content and, within minutes, crafts a beautifully realistic podcast episode. These podcasts feature virtual hosts who read and answer the questions in a natural, conversational manner. Everything from the topics discussed to the episode's thumbnail is decided by the AI, based on the letters received.

The podcasts are then available as MP3 files, ready for the station to broadcast either as full programs at predetermined times or as short segments throughout the day. All of this is done with minimal cost and no significant changes to existing systems, making it an incredibly efficient and accessible solution for communities in need.

Gemini Radio not only provides answers but also empowers entire communities by turning individual questions into shared knowledge. It’s a practical, adaptable tool that connects people with the information they need to improve their lives.

- ABSTRACT: Future STEM: Smart search with LaTeX

*** Description:
What it does

There are three problems I wanted to solve. First, as we acquire more knowledge, human brains are limited to remembering all of it. Instead of using our cognitive resources on memorization, I propose leveraging AI to assist us in focusing our brainpower on other pursuits, ultimately leading us to a better future through creative and innovative technology. Second, while we have developed AI, we often spend too much time crafting prompts to get accurate results. At least in the STEM fields, the knowledge and data that AI is trained on should be verified and certified, which is why I chose this type of customer. Many developers attempting to build AI applications often end up with a chat interface, which isn't always intuitive for humans. Therefore, I tried a different approach, like a ‘Multistep Search’. Third, since human life is short, we have collected and documented our knowledge throughout history to pass on to future generations. When we discover a new theory or knowledge in the STEM field, writing research papers becomes essential for informing and persuading others. This process requires us to include equations or formulas in a digital format. LaTeX offers a way to write mathematical equations in documents easily but still requires manual input, and this is the main theme of my application to make it simple and easier. I believe my application can help save time and increase the efficiency of this process and has some potential to change the future like Google.

*** Description:
What it does

A platform where non-developers can easily create, share, connect, and sell multi-agent crews that reflect their expertise and knowledge.
Groopy is a platform that allows non-developers to easily create, share, connect, and sell their own multi-agent teams. Traditionally, leveraging the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) required technical knowledge, but Groopy breaks down these barriers, enabling anyone to harness LLMs to create their own AI crews. Notably, Groopy uses the latest Google Gemini LLM, offering powerful and sophisticated capabilities to build even more effective AI teams. For example, a brilliant copywriter or video producer can create AI versions of themselves to collaborate on various tasks, showcasing their unique talents.

Once a crew is built, it executes tasks in the order set by the user. The completed crew can then be uploaded to the platform’s store, where others can use it. When others utilize the crew, the creator earns a share of the user fees, similar to how revenue is shared on YouTube. Groopy, by leveraging powerful LLMs like Google Gemini, opens up a new world where individuals can easily bring their expertise and creativity to life through interactive AI.

- ABSTRACT: Text-to-Simulation Code for System Dynamics

*** Description:
What it does

Humans usually have troubles understanding non-linear system dynamics, often leading to (very) costly mistakes and (very very) undesirable outcomes. Most of the time, this is not due to malevolence or lazyness, but rather lack of specific technical culture. The SODE project attempts to lower this entry barrier by leveraging two main elements:
1) A strong and robust reasoning structure, derived from expert practice in building system dynamics, ensuring a grounded approach
2) Gemini's wide knowledge, powerful understanding and instruction following capabilities to bring structure in what is otherwise a rather fuzzy and hardly computer usable content.

Essentially, Gemini is the engine used within SODE to design and iteratively construct specific system dynamics simulation code (that does not involve AI). Such scripts can then be launched, updated, helping users sharpen their sensibility about the considered domain. To further enhance accessibility, SODE simultaneously builds a pair graph structure, representing the system and easing interaction even more.

Finally, since getting system dynamics zero-shot is non-trivial, SODE also embeds a module for collaborative brainstorming with Gemini. In this mode, when an observation of a given simulation result is provided, Gemini will suggest several course of actions (updating parameters or constant values...) and apply the low-level selected changes for you, minimizing experiment friction.

*** Description:
What it does

Nobody knows how to find the lowest cost mortgage loan today, so most simply people do not comparison shop. Freddie Mac’s data shows that a single consumer leaves $1,200 on the table each year by failing to comparison shop, and over $1 billion in aggregate gets lost by consumers each year.
Using Google’s AI, we make the most convenient mortgage shopping experience today. We use Gemini and Document AI to create an AI mortgage shopping assistant that helps consumers easily comparison find the lowest cost mortgage loan without having to speak to a salesperson or have their sensitive data get sold. Our self-service experience includes:
1) Beat This Rate – upload an offer from another lender and we’ll let you know if another lender can beat it in under 30 seconds
2) Refinance Me – upload a current mortgage statement, and your desired monthly savings, and we’ll let you know if it’s a good time to refinance. If it’s not, you can subscribe to be notified as soon as it is.
3) Quote Me – answer several questions to generate a tailored quote that searches a network of lenders and mortgage brokers
We use Gemini Pro 1.5, and its ability to generate JSON responses for our JSON schemas. That reduces hallucinations and improves the quality of the inputs to call our proprietary pricing functions. Google’s Document AI also helps us parse documents like lender quotes and borrower mortgage statements so that we can provide a fast, tailored, self-service mortgage shopping experience.

*** Description:
What it does

With Urban Green, we can create greener, more sustainable, and more livable cities. By caring for just a few plants in their neighborhoods, individuals can make a significant impact. Urban Green makes this process easy. Users can share plants with the community, previously identified by Gemini, which then appear as pins on a map. Nearby users can adopt these plants and become responsible for their care.

What might seem challenging at first becomes simple with Gemini's assistance. The AI recognizes the plant's needs and provides tips on watering, fertilizing, and trimming. Users can chat with Gemini, upload pictures, and receive help with pests and diseases, ensuring the plant stays healthy.

Gemini also considers environmental factors like location, weather conditions, and time of year, and provides proactive notifications. The AI predicts when a plant needs care based on weather conditions and care history for timely care reminders/notifications.

To keep the community motivated, users can earn achievements by caring for their plants, making the experience rewarding and engaging.

*** Description:
What it does

Mindsync is an AI-based mindmap creation platform that allows users to harness the power of Gemini and create mindmaps in seconds. Mindmapping is a technique where information is represented in the form of a graph, called a mindmap - a process that has proved to increase learning ability by over 15% when compared to simple note-taking.

The conventional way of creating mindmaps is cumbersome - you can either make hand-drawn mindmaps or even if you're making them digitally, you need to use drag-and-drop interfaces that still require some effort.

Users can attach text (like pdfs of textbooks), images (such as pictures of their class notes), audio & video files (such as recordings of lectures) and then use all this information together to create one big mindmap.

Users can save created mindmaps to their account or edit the created maps in the AI Mindmap editor that is powered by Gemini. In the AI mindmap editor, they can edit the mindmap by sending messages to Gemini or even add more content to the mindmap by uploading additional files.

*** Description:
What it does

Wonder Story is a story generator app powered by Gemini AI. With the help of Gemini AI, you can generate stories for kids based on true facts or invented to educate children about concepts that may be difficult to understand for them. Just enter the prompt and let the AI do the rest. It is also possible to generate video with details that have been filled by Gemini.
The goal is to teach kids on factual information and make them curious about the world or fabricated stories to teach lessons.
Gemini generates story details divided into scenes. For each scene, the system uses Gemini’s details to generate or search images. Gemini then ensures the content is safe for children by selecting the appropriate image, which is then uploaded to Firebase Storage. The same process is applied to sound effects, with Gemini selecting the appropriate sound. Finally, the story is updated in Firestore.

- ABSTRACT: Automates differential expression analysis

*** Description:
What it does

The app is useful to find the most representative gene given a sample. Differential expression analysis is a method to decipher the interaction between genes and their environment.

The application is made under a service-based architecture. The “front” uses the Flutter SDK, coded in “Dart”, the graphical interface requests the CSV file where the samples are and you want to find the most representative gene on that “dataset”.

The “Backend” is coded in Python using “FastAPI” libraries and the “Uvicorn” web server. The magic of Gemini is in the back, using the “Langchain” framework. In a first phase, the most representative genes of the different “chunks” are found. Once the list of the most representative genes of the different “chunks” is available, Gemini is asked to find the most representative gene, giving a description of the process that was carried out and an explanation of the gene found.

*** Description:
What it does

The app helps you track eco activities and tells you how much worth of co2 you are offsetting by these activities.

How?
- you add a new task or upload a picture of the activity. For example, you created a compost, or took a bicycle instead of car to work or planted a few trees.
- we prompt gemini to ask further clarifying questions if required. These questions are quantifiable (either numerical or enum responses).
- we feed back the answer to gemini and ask it to give us a valid python code that we can run to give an accurate estimate of CO2 offset the activity has created.
- Gemini uses text and image data to ask clarifying questions and based on the answer help us calculate an activity specific number.

There are social and gamify features to the app as well. Where the more you share with people and more you save the environment, you unlock new characters and achievements.

So there are two nudges to user to do more good -
- see how others are contributing
- gamify and rank up yourself by doing more good

- TITLE: EverythingAI API  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: AI tasks trained without the need for dedicated large datasets.

*** Description:
What it does

This API can detect deepfakes, convert speech to text, analysis of ASL sign language, etc. without needing to be trained on any dataset. This is possible thanks to Gemini Flash 1.5 and their "Imposition-Context" technique.
This API currently includes AI tasks such as: deepfake detection, multilingual speech-to-text conversion with results exceeding whisper-large-v3 on multilingual audio, detailed and accurate analysis and interpretation of sign language in videos, classification of up to 80 emotional states of text in just 2 seconds, and OCR with character detection and accuracy comparable to existing large OCR systems. And I am still working on integrating more AI tasks.
If we simply feed the video to Gemini Flash 1.5 on its own, it won't be able to detect the deepfake. You can see here, Gemini Flash 1.5 is struggling to identify the deepfake. This is why I developed the "Imposing-context" prompting technique.
Instead of the traditional approach where the user prompts the model and waits for it to interpret the context on its own, "Imposing-context" directly dictates the model's output history. The model itself doesn't actually write the responses, those are written by me.
But when it looks at the chat history, it mistakenly believes it generated those answers. This forces it to understand the user's intent. As you can see, this approach gives amazing results. Gemini Flash 1.5 is not only able to analyze deepfakes but also achieves incredible accuracy.

*** Description:
What it does

Imagine you could talk to AI characters anywhere in whatever language you like and they’ll respond. Just picture you could control not only their personality and voice, but also teach them how to carry out commands for you and draw on external knowledge in your games.
Wingman AI is a local client-server app that runs on Windows and MacOS. The backend is open source and written in Python, while the frontend is a closed source Web App. The UI is easy to use, so both AI fans and gamers can use different AI providers to make their Wingmen their own.
A Wingman is a combination of personality prompts, a text-to-speech, speech-to-text and LLM provider configuration, command definitions and optional skills.
Wingman AI Core handles the synthesis of the user’s speech, then sends it to Gemini, processes the response and finally transforms it back into speech. It uses AI function calling to execute commands like keypresses or macros that users can record in the frontend and run without having to learn exact activation phrases.
Skills are basically attachable custom Python scripts/extensions that allow a Wingman to run any code which can be used to connect to external APIs, SDKs, AI vision etc.
Wingman AI isn’t limited to Gemini but we integrated it as first-class provider as soon as we got access to it. We found it to be an excellent model to handle complex system prompts and long conversations and are also impressed by its summarization capabilities.

- TITLE: Casegen RN  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: A tool for nursing instructors to create adaptive case studies.

*** Description:
What it does

Nursing instructors often want to provide their learners with authentic scenarios that they can easily customize and adapt to help further understanding. Traditional prompting with a chatbot can be a struggle for many subject matter experts to create case studies. Casegen RN solves both of these problems by creating a user interface that is intuitive and leverages the power of the Gemini API to quickly generate custom variables that relate to the basic case study premise that nursing instructors want to develop.
From there, the tool allows the user to specify specific nursing documentation that they want created. The tool then uses Gemini to create relevant and aligned case study documentation that is both aligned to the target outcomes and is also formatted for easy viewing. A key feature of this tool is the ability for instructors to edit the resulting case study and ensure content is accurate.
This human-in-the-loop approach makes our tool not only useful but also a responsible use of generative artificial intelligence. Finally, users can create sets of questions that align to different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy of Higher Order Thinking. This means that nursing instructors can adapt a case study to different levels of learners, making this tool and the cases it generates highly adaptable.

*** Description:
What it does

ExamAI is a platform built entirely with Flutter, designed to simplify grading for professors and enhance learning for students. The platform has two main portals: Professor and Student, both accessible via Firebase Login. All the data is stored securely in Firebase databases.

Here's how it works: When a professor creates an exam, homework, or any kind of assessment, they input the questions, weights, and rubrics. This information is then sent to the Gemini API. Using prompt engineering, Gemini compares the student's answers with the rubrics and provides a score. This process delivers instant, secure, and unbiased grading, especially beneficial for schools with limited resources for teaching assistants. It saves professors valuable time.

Gemini doesn't just grade the answers; it also provides detailed feedback on how students can improve based on the rubrics. This is particularly helpful in subjects like math, physics, or programming, where understanding the process is as important as the final answer. By using a lower temperature setting in the Gemini API, we ensure consistent and fair grading for all students.

*** Description:
What it does

Karamashth analyzes individual's profile, identifies the strengths, weaknesses, and career goals. By comparing individual's profile with other successful individuals in respective field, it generates a tailored roadmap for one's growth. Here Advanced AI models, including document AI, recommendation AI, and prediction AI, work together to provide actionable insights. There are two different paths to selects: "PDF doc gap analysis" and "Image gap analysis". The uploaded docs are treated as RAG thus gemini will have bounded context. For PDF analysis, I have used "gemini-1.5-pro-001" model with right blend of prompt engineering including few-shot examples, thus the response can come in HTML page with unique checkboxes for all the tasks of a given roadmap (in this case, "Technical manager to CEO"). Then for Image analysis, I have fusion the two models: "gemini-1.0-pro-vision-001" that analyze the images and find the gaps based on the prompt provided, however vision model is limited to vision only thus I again used "gemini-1.5-pro-001" model with old few-shot example prompt to get the HTML page with unique checkboxes task for Image analysis. And Karamashth offered to select different task and prepare unique roadmap (based on personal choices) then I called 3rd model "gemini-1.5-flash-001" to get the quick suggestion for given roadmap and task to accomplish. Last by not the least, Karamashth is tracking the progress graph of each roadmap to help one's aspiration!

Nottri Online IDE is designed to help developers, educators, and coding enthusiasts who often struggle with the complexities of coding syntax, project management, and workflow efficiency. These challenges can lead to frustration, especially for beginners, and slow down productivity for more experienced developers.
To address these issues, I integrated the Gemini API into a Django project by creating fetch API. This integration allows Nottri to leverage the power of Gemini's natural language processing capabilities. Users can interact with the IDE as if they were talking to a team member, issuing commands in plain language to create files, manage projects, and execute code. The Gemini API interprets these commands and performs the necessary actions within the IDE, providing real-time feedback and support.
This approach simplifies coding, making it more accessible and intuitive. For beginners, it removes the barrier of understanding complex syntax, allowing them to focus on learning the concepts. For experienced developers, it streamlines repetitive tasks, enabling them to concentrate on more critical aspects of their projects. Overall, Nottri enhances the coding experience, making it more efficient and enjoyable, while fostering an inclusive environment for learning and collaboration.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app is designed to assist students in applying to universities in Germany and track their progress throughout the process. Additionally, we offer a job tracker that enables students and professionals to manage their job applications, keeping track of each one’s status.

To enhance their experience, we leverage Gemini AI in the following ways:

Job Tracker: We automatically extract key information from job postings, such as salary, location, email address, and, most importantly, the job description.

AI-Powered Resumes: Based on the courses or jobs they shortlist, users can create AI-generated resumes with Gemini. These resumes can be built either from scratch or by refining an existing one.

Cover Letters and SOPs: Since many universities require a statement of purpose (SOP) or cover letter, students can create these documents directly within the app using Gemini AI. This feature can also be used to craft personalized cover letters for job applications, significantly reducing the time needed to apply.

We encourage users to review and customize the AI-generated resumes and cover letters to best reflect their unique qualifications and personality.

- ABSTRACT: Enhancing innovation with cross-domain analogy and idea matchmaking

*** Description:
What it does

Overview: Gemidea is an app to enhance innovation ideation process, whether you are solving a problem, exploring a design, developing an innovative business model or other scenarios. Gemidea has 2 unique features, made possible by using Gemini Large Language Model. 1) First feature, is a Cross-domain, Ideation by Analogy tool.
When dealing with a problem, it is quite common, that there already exists out there, problem or solution similar in structure to what we are trying to solve.
The main idea here is that using Gemini Large-Language Model, we can detect structural similarities, or analog, between our problem, with problems from many other domains. We use that, to draw inspirations from invented solutions from other domains. In principle these solutions can be drawn by combining information from various knowledge databases, including Patents, academic journals, Wikipedia etc.
However to simplify operation for the purpose of this prototype, we will be using only Wikipedia as the target domains reference.
2) Second feature, is an Intelligent Matchmaking Assistant.
This feature helps user to connect with potential collaborators, by an intelligent match-making process. Imagine for instance, a scenario where an inventor looking for collaborator, but only want to collaborate with others that are thinking of similar ideas. Closing note: The two features are built on top of text editing app called Wordcraft by Google's People AI Research Initiative.

LegalEase is an innovative web application, designed to streamline the judicial process by offering a virtual courtroom for civil cases. This platform enables users to submit cases involving any form of illegal misconduct and facilitates efficient, fair resolutions through online proceedings.
At the heart of LegalEase is "The BLaW", a Gemini powered virtual judge. The BLaW leverages Gemini LLM to analyze the details of each case, including discussions between the involved parties and the submitted evidence. Prompt engineering has been done on top of Gemini LLM to generate each response of “The BLaW”. Based on the ongoing discussion feed and current input of the user, it will determine which party (plaintiff or defendant) is in stronger position. It will also verify the attached evidence, to see if it really supports the case. At any point of time, it will describe the next course of actions for both plaintiff and defendant. Furthermore, it will also quote similar instances from the past and what was the final conclusion of those cases. It will also state the sections from Indian Law under which the current case falls.
LegalEase not only helps in reducing the backlog of cases but also makes the legal process more transparent and accessible to a broader audience.
In summary, LegalEase leverages the power of LLM to provide a modern and efficient solution, addressing the challenges of the traditional judicial system and paving the way for a more equitable legal ecosystem.

Illumine automates traditional teaching and evaluation using Gemini AI, leveraging LLM prompting techniques to achieve desired outcomes. Instructors upload course content, which Gemini AI processes to generate a structured curriculum. We utilize Role, Task, and Format (RTF) Structural Prompting to simulate course creators, evaluators, and instructor personas, enabling the AI to effectively organize content into a weekly curriculum with teaching notes and in-class activities.
For evaluations, instructors specify the number and types of questions. We apply Recursive Task-Based Prompts in Zero-Shot and Few-Shot modes to guide the AI in generating assessments, including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, true/false, and short answer questions. These techniques ensure that each question aligns with course content and educational objectives while generating accurate answer keys.
During grading, chain of thought (CoT) prompts are used to instruct Gemini AI in evaluating student responses, determining correctness, and providing concise explanations. This ensures feedback is contextually relevant with no hallucination, and enhances the learning experience.
By integrating these advanced prompting techniques at each step, Illumine maximizes Gemini AI’s capabilities, delivering a tailored, efficient, and scalable educational solution. This approach is especially beneficial in under-resourced settings, where maintaining high educational standards is challenging.

- ABSTRACT: App that analyzes facial images to generate skincare routines

*** Description:
What it does

Skin Care AI leverages AI to provide personalized skincare solutions by analyzing users' facial images. When a user uploads their image, our app uses the Google Gemini API to process and analyze the photo, identifying key skin attributes such as texture, tone, and problem areas. The AI then matches these attributes with appropriate skincare product categories, including cleansers, moisturizers, serums, and masks.

The Gemini API's advanced image processing capabilities allow us to accurately assess skin conditions and ensure precise product matches, enhancing the skincare regimen's overall user experience and efficacy. By simplifying the process to a single image upload, our app makes personalized skincare accessible, efficient, and highly effective for users.

In the long term, we plan to integrate this information into a CMS system, enabling beauty companies to offer each user tailored product recommendations and custom skincare routines, providing valuable insights and marketing opportunities.

- ABSTRACT: Discover safe choices with InsideOut - Scan and know your products!

*** Description:
What it does

How does InsideOut Work?
It's super simple to use. Just open the app and snap a photo of any product label or ingredient list. InsideOut gets to work right away, breaking down all that confusing information into something you can actually understand. But here's where it gets really cool. InsideOut also provides an option where you can choose to provide details about yourself or your preferences. Things like:
- Do you have any allergies?
- Are you on a special diet, like keto or vegan?
- Do you have any health conditions InsideOut should know about?
Once you've told InsideOut a bit about yourself, InsideOut becomes your personal food and product detective. Every time you scan something, it doesn't just tell you what's in it - it tells you if it's good for YOU.
Let's say you're allergic to peanuts and you scan a granola bar. InsideOut will immediately warn you if there are peanuts or peanut traces in it. Or maybe you're trying to cut down on sugar. InsideOut will let you know if that "healthy" snack is actually a sugar bomb in disguise.
Making Sense of What You See
We know that sometimes you just want a quick yes or no. That's why we use a simple color and number system:
- Green means go! This product is great for you.
- Yellow means be careful. It might not be the best choice.
- Red means stop and think twice. This product could be bad for you.
The numbers work the same way, from 1 (watch out!) to 5 (all good!). It's like having a traffic light for your shopping cart.

AquaFlora is an aquarium management mobile app that helps fish keepers manage reminders, water parameters, fish stocking, and more. The user can create tanks with a name, volume, and image. Reminders, water parameters, fish stocking are all organized under each respective tank, along with a Gemini generated description, a Gemini evaluated tank health, and a Gemini evaluated fish compatibility (compatible, not compatible, compatible with caution). There is a list of 650+ freshwater aquarium species, with images, scientific names, link to each Wikipedia page, details about each fish, and a Gemini summarized description from the Wikipedia page.
The information centre contains Gemini generated, and verified aquarium advice targeted toward novice hobbyists.
The chat bot has been trained on verified aquarium related topics such as water parameter measuring guides, fish & plant care, equipment, maintenance, algae management, advanced water chemistry.
Built into the chat bot is a quick action modal to showcase possible features because just a chat doesn't explain the full capabilities. Some quick actions include adding reminders to google calendar, generating a report on a tanks known data, logging water parameters, adding fish to each tank.
Also included in the chat bot is a fish/plant/disease detection via Gemini vision. Through testing this has shown to be about 90% accurate.

- TITLE: GitWatt  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Analyze your git repository by AI and get real-world costs

*** Description:
What it does

Project Name: GitWatt

Overview: GitWatt allows users to determine various real-world costs associated with running code from a Git repository, including power consumption, carbon footprint, and public cloud expenses.

Mechanism:
- Git Repository Analysis: The project analyzes the code components and minimum resource specifications (CPU, RAM) needed to run the code. Since the Gemini API doesn't natively analyze Git URLs, LangChain was utilized.

- Cloud Instance Data Collection: For AWS, we parsed instance information provided in JSON format. For GCP, we built a custom web crawler using Selenium to collect data by running simulations on the GCP Cloud Calculator and storing the results in our database.

- Efficiency Comparison: We compare the specs of AWS and GCP instances to analyze power consumption and carbon footprint for running an instance for an hour, using Gemini.
Scoring and Recommendations: The tool then ranks and displays the most efficient cloud instance options for executing the code, based on various cost factors.

- Ultimately, GitWatt provides insights into the various costs associated with running Git code, including cloud simulation results and real-world expenses.

P.S.
Except for the cloud instance data collection and parsing functionality, everything else was built using Firebase. The frontend is hosted on Firebase App Hosting with Next.js, the backend is powered by Firebase Functions 2nd generation (Python 3), and Firestore is used as the database.

*** Description:
What it does

The "Know Your Rights" app is a Django/React webapp informing users about legal rights and support resources across countries. Users input nationality, current country, and an incident to receive relevant rights and institutional contacts. A learning mode generates scenarios based on user-provided context for educational purposes. Users can edit scenarios to explore further. The app includes error handling for irrelevant inputs and incomplete fields.
Gemini API Integration:
1.	Rights and Contact Generation: We send prompts to the Gemini API with user's nationality, country, and incident details, requesting relevant legal rights and institutional contacts.
2.	Scenario Creation: For learning mode, we prompt the API with nationality, country, and context, asking for realistic scenarios, which then is used to generate appropriate rights and contacts.
We structure prompts to get specific information needed. The API returns text responses, which we process and format for the React frontend.
By using Gemini AI, our app provides dynamic, personalized legal information without a pre-populated database, adapting to various contexts and user needs across countries and situations.

With ZEN, you can easily track your mood, allowing you to record your current emotional state—whether you’re feeling happy, stressed, or anything in between. Based on your mood, ZEN curates personalised content, including videos and podcasts, to help you find balance and comfort

In our ZEN app, we utilized the Gemini API to power several core features, including goal recommendations, an AI chat bot for mental health conversations, dynamic questionnaires, and content recommendations based on user mood. The app's backend is built with Flask, allowing us to handle requests efficiently while integrating seamlessly with the Gemini API. We used Firestore as our database to store user data, chat history, and personalized content, leveraging its real-time capabilities for a smooth user experience. To ensure secure access, we implemented Firebase Authentication for user sign-up and login processes, safeguarding sensitive information. On the client side, we chose Flutter for its versatility in creating cross-platform applications, enabling us to deliver a responsive and engaging interface for users. This architecture not only provides a robust foundation for ZEN but also allows for easy scalability and future enhancements.

- ABSTRACT: 8bit Android retro game which will walk you through space battles

*** Description:
What it does

The aim of the game is to escalate charts based on the level you choose:
Easy, Medium or Hard.
Just by clicking a button, a counter will be incremented in realtime (Firebase Firestore).
The time has been set differently for each level.
Sometimes some aliens will appear which will give or subtract you some points or seconds.
Gemini has been employed for these purposes:
- Check if the username chosen at registration time is racist, homophobic, harmful or negative in some way
- Invent a story, obviously before the game starts, in order to make UX interesting and let the user be part of the game by mentioning him/her into the story itself
- Generate some objects during the game that will let you gain or lose some points or time, given the game level you choose
A special consideration has been made for accessibility.
It will be a good experience to play this game for visually impaired people, too.
Everyone must have fun!

- ABSTRACT: Fantasy is all you need

*** Description:
What it does

Generative Based Authentication (GBA) is an innovative authentication method developed by 4DA. This app is just a proof of concept and the emphasis is on the sign-in phase.
Here’s how it works:
Sign-Up Process:
Email Link: The user receives an email containing a link to a story generator powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), such as GPT.
Story Creation: The user generates a story of their choice using the provided generator.
Story Approval: Once the user is satisfied with the story, it is saved, completing the sign-up process.
Sign-In Process:
Email Submission: To sign in, the user provides their registered email address.
Story-Based Question: The system presents a question based on the unique story generated during sign-up.
Authentication: If the user correctly answers the question, access is granted. If not, access is denied.
Additional Features:
Story Modification: Users can change their story at any time, along with the way questions are generated and answered.
Web-Based Convenience: The entire process is web-based, eliminating the need for any extra app installations.
Device Compatibility: Unlike many authentication apps like BankID, which require modern smart devices and may no longer work on older devices, GBA only requires access to a web browser, ensuring broader compatibility and accessibility.

- ABSTRACT: Highly personalised news with summary in the style you want!

*** Description:
What it does

NewsApp is a web app that curates news articles for the user, based on whatever data they choose to enter as their personal information. The user also enters a summary style, used for summarising of all the curated news articles.
The purpose of this application is to deliver highly personalised news and to save the reader's time, while making it enjoyable.
Example- a user enters following two things as their personal information and summary style:
Personal information: "I am a businessman from the United States. I invest in stocks. I like reading non-fiction books, watching live sports, especially tennis."
Summary Style: "Goblin from Lord of the rings"
Based on these, the web app curates news-articles and also provides a summary.
Usage of Gemini AI:
1. Identifying keywords for the news query.
For curating news articles, we are using an external news articles API.
Here, when we ask the user for 'Personal Information', it means they may enter as much data as they want. This string is passed in as a prompt and Gemini AI returns an array of keywords. For above example, the AI might return: [business,stocks,tennis]. The keywords are passed in the News API's query for finding articles.
2. Summarising articles
The links obtained from news articles, fetched from the API, are passed in as a second prompt to the Gemini API.
Along with user's stored Summary Style and the links to these articles, the prompt requests Gemini AI to summarise all the content in news articles.

In today’s online environment, users, especially teens, are exposed to vast amounts of information, some of which can be misleading or harmful. Vibo uses Gemini to offer guidance on content that promotes negative values, and ensures users receive accurate information.

YouTube is a vital platform for information, yet users' knowledge varies widely. Vibo leverages Gemini to tailor supplementary information based on the user's background, ensuring everyone gains maximum benefit from the content they watch.

With Gemini's summarization integrated, users can skip part of video without worrying about missing key information.

Additionally, YouTube contains the largest set of learning resources globally. Vibo can function as a personalized learning assistant. It creates a tailored learning plan based on the user's background and needs, finds the best video for each learning step, playing the videos, and offering comments to further explore the content. The chatbot provides a more effective, personalized, and engaging learning experience.

Just to mention, Vibo is a research and demo project at this stage, not commercial. I'm a student and still learning, but I’m really excited about the possibility of seeing if some of these features could one day fit into YouTube. I’d love the chance to explore that further if there’s ever an opportunity.

ITMZ is a personal inventory app that empowers users to track, search, and share all their home goods. By leveraging Gemini's advanced AI, you can effortlessly create and maintain detailed inventories of your own home. First, set up your spaces: these can be however broad (“house”) or specific (“bottom drawer”). You can add spaces within other spaces, such as a “closet” in your “bedroom”. Thanks to Gemini, adding items into the spaces only takes a few seconds. Take a photo of your space and Gemini will list the items it finds. Simply tap on the items you want to keep track of and they will be added to the database. You can also choose to keep track of item properties such as cost, percent remaining, or even a text description of the item - Gemini will predict these from the photo.

Spaces can be shared with other users such as family members or roommates, enabling everyone to stay organized. ITMZ goes beyond simple tracking by allowing users to ask Gemini natural language questions about their inventory. Need to find missing items or check if you have enough supplies? Gemini provides instant, informative answers. Next time you are at the store, and you can’t remember if you already have some of an item at home, just pull out your phone and ask Gemini! With ITMZ, users can easily find what they need, reduce household clutter, and save money by avoiding duplicate purchases.

- ABSTRACT: Empowering you with Gemini, no internet required.

*** Description:
What it does

The conversation around AI takes internet access for granted. But for most of the world, the internet is prohibitively expensive. In fact, some of the poorest countries in the world have the highest costs. This means that people who can benefit the most from AI and LLMs like Google Gemini, are the least likely to be able to access it. That is why we came up with GeminiSMS. GeminiSMS gives you the power of Google Gemini, without the internet. Whether you're looking to bridge the digital divide or enhance local innovation, GeminiSMS aims to empower communities in even the most remote areas by offering Gemini via SMS.
Steps:
SMS: The process begins when a user sends an SMS to a special number. This text message could be queries or information that the user wishes to use AI for.
Communications Client: The incoming SMS is received by a communications client, which forwards the message to a server using a webhook. Gemini: The server uses Google Gemini to generate a response which is limited to 150 characters due to SMS limitations.

- ABSTRACT: Revolutionizing QA with AI-driven automation

*** Description:
What it does

QAutomator is an AI-powered application designed to streamline and automate the testing process for mobile apps. By analyzing video recordings of app usage, QAutomator captures and processes video frames to generate detailed functional flows, comprehensive UI-based test cases, and automated Appium code. This approach eliminates the manual effort traditionally associated with mobile app testing, making the process faster, more efficient, and highly reliable.

Leveraging the cutting-edge Gemini API, QAutomator delivers intelligent insights by interpreting visual data from the app's user interface. The app captures key moments in the video, selects frames with significant UI changes, and creates a collage for easy visualization. This collage is then analyzed using the Gemini API, which generates a step-by-step functionality flow, identifying user interactions and system responses.

QAutomator takes the analysis further by using the Gemini API to create detailed UI-based test cases from the functionality flow. These test cases are designed to cover all possible scenarios, focusing on static UI elements and predictable behaviors rather than dynamic data from APIs. Moreover, QAutomator uses the Gemini API to generate Appium code from the test cases, enabling seamless automated testing across Android and iOS platforms.

With QAutomator, developers and QA teams can ensure thorough testing coverage, reduce time to market, and enhance the overall quality of their mobile applications.

- TITLE: Wunderous  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: re-Imagining generative AI as social platform for humans

*** Description:
What it does

Wunderous explores an idea related to multi-agent AI conversations, but in different direction: connecting multiple humans through a single Gemini instance that acts as a mediator among them e.g. consider this chat:
- Houman: Can you tell Sara that I said Hi?
- Gemini: Sure, I will let Sara know.
(later)
- Sara: Any news since we last interacted?
- Gemini: Yes, Houman said Hi!
Wunderous relies on system instructions to help Gemini generate cohesive dialogues, e.g. to avoid an invalid dialogue such as
- Houman: Can you tell Sara that I said Hi?
- Gemini: Sure Houman! Hey Sara, Houman is saying Hi!
(This is invalid because, from Houman's perspective, it's not addressing him, and also because Sara might not be interacting with Wunderous until much later.)
Just as a proof of concept, instructions for interactive stories and textcasting with an audience are included, but the core objective is to provide a toolset for experimenting with various instructions and setups for multi-user generative conversations e.g. a moderated debate room, a journalism channel, etc. The toolset, in particular, includes real-time chat via Firebase. I chose Gemini Flash for content generation as Gemini Pro can be costly in a long chat with a large token count. However, Gemini Pro is still used in the 'Interaction Validator' to validate individual user prompt and Flash response pairs, providing JSON schema-based 'corrective instructions' for Flash to retry whenever the pair is evaluated as invalid.

*** Description:
What it does

AI-Team Overview
Don't blame the game, blame the player.
AI-Team is a TDPnet system comprising the following Service Providers (SPs):
Desk: Facilitates connections for gamers and spectators to access the game. There are two types of desks:
Gamer Desk (G-Desk): For gamers.
Spectator Desk (E-Desk): For spectators.
Player: Implements the logic of a player, which can be controlled by either a human or a Large Language Model (LLM). Currently, there are six player SPs, with three players on each team.
Kronia: Synchronizes processes across the system to ensure consistent performance.
Hub: Acts as a central node where desks, players, and Kronia connect to notify actions and events. It also maintains the game's parameters and updated state.
Purpose and Functionality
The primary goal of AI-Team is to evaluate player performance within a team context. Each player receives the necessary information to make informed decisions.
Gamers interact with the system by pointing to locations on the playground, providing clues to the selected team about where to move the ball next. By default, the selected team is 'a', but gamers can select any player on the field to change the team.
The core principle of gameplay is encapsulated in the MaMBe strategy (Minimum Action, Maximum Benefit).
Usage Instructions
To use AI-Team, download the project from https://github.com/riemaxi/gamia.git and follow the instructions in the README file.

This Flutter app plays a scavenger/treasure hunt game where players guess 10 restaurants or tourist spots based on three clues each, all generated by the Gemini API. The game first uses the player's device location to generate a list of 10 restaurants and tourist places, and then Gemini generates three clues for each place. The game offers five difficulty levels: "Virtual Voyage" (home), "City Code Cape" (within the city), "State Secret Search" (within the state), "National Nautical Nightmare" (within the country), and "World Wind Wander" (worldwide). Players earn 100 points per correct guess, with additional points for uploading receipts or photos analyzed by the Gemini API. If the uploaded image contains the place's name and the app recognizes it with the help of Gemini API, players receive a 10,000-point bonus, ensuring they're physically present. The app is translated into eight languages with ARB files for static text and Google Translation API for clues, though answers must be in English. Features include a heatmap for tracking guesses, game sharing via a game ID, public hunts, a scoreboard prototype, and dark/light themes. Available on Android and iOS, the app has been tested in cities like New Delhi, Paris, and São Paulo, with Gemini ensuring clue generation works worldwide.

- TITLE: EAGLE AI  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Your AI-Powered Security Monitor

*** Description:
What it does

After using popular security systems like Ring, we noticed a large amount of false positive notifications. Eventually, many of us became desensitized to these imprecise alerts, making it hard to determine if the warning was for an actual emergency or for something as minor as a stray animal. Receiving notifications such as "There Is Motion Detected at Your Front Door" doesn't provide enough details. This is a huge problem, especially in home security, where every second counts.

We enhance security systems by leveraging Gemini to provide immediate, actionable security reports through text messages. Our system, EAGLE (Enhanced Automated Guardian for Living Environments) AI, reduces false positive notifications and provides detailed summaries of any detected irregularities. We have two versions of this project: one where you can access a Google Nest camera feed using the Device Access API, and another where you can use your own computer webcam through a Streamlit app for demonstration.

Features:
- Detailed summary of irregularities instead of generic notifications.
- Estimates severity and provides options for next steps.
- Applications in a variety of surveillance settings, including at home, stores, events, or any other environment where a security monitor would be needed.

This empowers the users with the immediate information needed to respond to the situation instead of having a person continuously monitor footage.

Our app utilizes the Gemini API to automate a costly and time-consuming workflow of Client Service Associates working at expert network firms. This workflow involves them analyzing a business problem that their client presents them with and then determining how to translate that into a key word search into search engines like Google, or LinkedIn, then manually reading through thousands of profiles to find subject matter experts that can help their client with that problem. With Iris, we have Gemini automatically generating key words based on whatever arbitrary business problem the user has. Then Iris, performs a parallelized key word search to grab relevant people. It then navigates to each of their profiles, and analyzes all of their content using Gemini. We use the Gemini API again to then rank the experts by priority of relevancy to the user’s specific problem. We returns it to the frontend. Then, the user can select which of those experts it wants Iris to reach out to with personalized offers which Gemini generates based on the context with the user, or ask follow-up questions with those selected experts passed in as further context for Gemini (e.g. “find me more people like them”).

*** Description:
What it does

StoryMagic is a native Android app for young kids (~2-10 years old) to explore their creativity and imagination by generating short stories that align with their interests.
The aim of the app is to give kids an engaging activity that can capture their attention and help improve their reading skills.
The app allows kids (or parents) to enter a childs pedigree information. From that point on, kids themselves are presented with a fluid, easy-to-use interface that guides them to generating a short story. Thanks to Gemini, we're able to incorporate the child themselves into the story and allow them to select topics that are of interest, all in an age-appropriate way.
Gemini powers the generation of story ideas, writes the script and generates all associated metadata to do with the book. We take advantage of Gemini's response schema support and safety configurations to do this with reliable and appropriate outputs.
We use the Gemini ImageNet API to generate story covers and images for each page.
The app is built using a host of google products and services, from Firebase Firestore and Storage, to Cloud functions and hosting for building web-friendly, sharable versions of a story.
The app is highly animated, colourful and polished in a way keeping it's young audience in mind. We've intentionally hidden any prompting/complexity when typically dealing with an LLM and have made several intentional UX choices to help mask any waiting time when generating AI content.

Daedalo leverages the power of Gemini (via Firebase Vertex AI sdk) to capture text out of these sources and generate structured concept maps, enhancing the learning process and making it both fun and engaging. Students often face challenges in processing and retaining information from textbooks, lectures, or even personal notes. Traditional study methods like highlighting and underlining often fall short in helping them understand and retain complex material.
Many people find it difficult to grasp intricate concepts presented in dense text or fast-paced lectures. This can lead to frustration, hindering personal and professional growth.
Daedalo empowers users to overcome these hurdles by providing a powerful tool to visualize and organize information. By converting pictures, images, pdf documents and audio into mind maps, we help users identify key points, uncover hidden connections, and foster a stronger grasp of the subject matter.
Also, Daedalo allows users to modify and personalize their concept maps, update notes, change colors, add/remove nodes of the maps, print them if needed or save them to Cloud Firestore, ensuring that their learning materials are always up-to-date and readily available.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app is an Assistive Technology application which is primarily focused on aiding ALS patients. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a Neuro degenerative disease which leaves the patient completely paralyzed. Everything including their mouth, torso and limbs are paralyzed. The only parts of their body they can move are their eyes and cheek muscles. ALS is not congenital, which means the patient grew up with a normal lifestyle and suddenly lost his ability to communicate with their loved ones. To combat this, the primary feature of the app is the communication feature which uses Google Gemini in an innovative way. When someone talks to the user the app records their voice. This recording of what they say is used by Gemini to generate appropriate responses. The users can then use simple eye movements to choose any one of the provided responses. This enables them to communicate and express their feelings even if they are completely paralyzed and can't speak. To provide the user with more independence the secondary feature of the app is Smart Home Automation, where the user can control smart home appliances like fans, lights etc, independently. The app also prioritizes safety by offering an alert feature which enables the user to alert either their caretaker or their doctor when there is an emergency. Future enhancements include entertainment features to for the users, but most importantly, integration with infrared camera to increase eye tracking accuracy in low light conditions.

- TITLE: CitizenOne  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: CitizenOne is the AI powered, unified voice of the community.

*** Description:
What it does

CitizenOne is inspired by a sci-fi story: Supernova Era by Cixin Liu where an AI virtual citizen who communicates the needs of the citizens with the Leaders. CitizenOne uses Gemini API to parse issues raised by a community of citizens and maps them onto ESG pillars. Then, it uses Gemini to find the unified, singular voice of the citizens in an area (by zipcode) and turns it into a CitizenOne issue. These issues, mapped to the ESG pillars, are shown to community leaders who can champion them and get them solved, thus brining transparency to governance. Leaders will soon be able to create their own profile and run campaigns, thereby ensuring that each persona: citizen, current leader, prospective leader, CSR orgs are incentivized to be on the platform.

Further, CitizenOne uses Gemini AI for the following:
- Anonymizing the inputs to preserve privacy of citizens (and prevent backlash)
- Tagging citizen one issues as something which organizations can support
- Upcoming: Letting organizations search for issues they can donate towards/support as a way of giving back to communities
- Upcoming: automatically searching news articles to mark certain tasks as finished when leaders claim they've worked on the issues, matching non-profits with organizations and community issues

Here's a script you can use for a 1-minute presentation about your travel project:
Script:
"Hello everyone,
I'm excited to share with you a project I've been working on—a travel planning web application built using Node.js and the Gemini API. This app is designed to help anyone plan their perfect trip with just a few simple inputs.
When users visit the site, they can enter their desired destination, travel preferences, the number of people, and their budget. Based on this information, the app generates a comprehensive travel itinerary that includes activity plans, budget breakdowns, important considerations, and accommodation options.
For example, if you're planning a trip to Indore with a preference for lakes, the app will suggest relevant activities, like a morning boat ride or an evening walk by the water, and provide recommendations for accommodations that fit your budget.
The beauty of this app is its simplicity and efficiency—everything is tailored to your specific needs, making it easier for travelers to enjoy a well-organized trip without the hassle of manual planning.
In short, this project leverages the power of Node.js and the Gemini API to deliver a personalized and user-friendly travel planning experience. I hope you'll find it as useful as I do!"

Leveraging the capabilities of the Gemini API along with Google's computer vision and image generation algorithms, this app provides personalized outfit suggestions to enhance your daily wardrobe choices.

It all starts when you're thinking about your outfit. For example, you might be shopping and looking at a piece of clothing while asking questions like:
* What colors can be matching with this piece?
* Should I choose this or that?
* How do these two pieces look together?

Simply, you just scan that piece of clothing, and the magic happens:
* Using the Google Gemini API, the app detects all properties of the scanned clothes and suggests an elegant and consistent outfit.
* Using the Google Imagen API, the app generates an image of the recommended outfit.
* Gemini thinks like you, and suggests potential and likely touches or modifications that you might think of, so it gives you most relevant prompts so that you can quickly make edits to the outfit with a single screen touch! This feature we call "Hot Prompts".

- TITLE: Hangman Game  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: This is a classic word-guessing game built using React and Gemini AI.

*** Description:
What it does

The game follows the traditional rules of Hangman, where players try to reveal a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Incorrect guesses result in a part of a stick figure being drawn, and the game ends when the figure is fully drawn or the word is successfully guessed.

Key Features:
1. User Interface: The game's UI is built with React, ensuring a dynamic and responsive experience.

2. Word Generation: The Gemini AI API is leveraged to generate random words for each game session. This adds an element of unpredictability and challenge, as players encounter a wide range of words.

3. Game Logic: The game logic is managed using React's state and effect hooks.

4. Feedback and Interactions: Players receive immediate visual feedback for their guesses.

5. Game Over Conditions: The game checks for win or loss conditions after each guess, updating the UI to display a message and offering the option to start a new game.

Using Gemini API:
1. Fetching Words: Upon starting a new game, the React component makes an API call to Gemini AI to fetch a random word. The word is then set as the target word for the game.

2. API Integration: The integration with Gemini API is done using Axios for making HTTP requests.

3. Error Handling: Error handling is implemented to manage cases where the API call fails, ensuring the game can gracefully handle such scenarios and provide appropriate feedback to the user.

*** Description:
What it does

AnyRadio is an innovative app that transforms users’ memories and moments into personalized radio shows. By simply uploading photos or screenshots, the Gemini API analyzes the content and automatically generates a unique radio show tailored just for you.

I created this app to showcase the incredible potential and appeal of Gemini to as many people as possible. While Gemini is a powerful generative AI, its full potential might not be accessible to everyone, especially those unfamiliar with AI tools. To make this technology more accessible, I designed AnyRadio with a simple user experience—just upload an image, and Gemini handles the rest, making advanced AI accessible to all.

Gemini API plays a crucial role in analyzing the uploaded images, generating radio scripts, titles, descriptions, and categorizing the shows into genres. It also generates prompts for creating thumbnail images. Additionally, Google’s Text-to-Speech converts the generated scripts into natural-sounding audio, while Imagen2 creates visually appealing thumbnails that capture the essence of each radio show.

AnyRadio harnesses the advanced capabilities of Gemini to turn everyday moments into rich audio experiences. With its user-friendly interface, anyone can easily enjoy personalized radio shows that bring their unique memories and experiences to life, making AnyRadio not just a tool, but a companion for reminiscing and exploring the stories that matter most.

*** Description:
What it does

We've made gemini able to generate web site, flutter app, video, powerpoint, word file and more
with just a single line of input.

We've developed a tool that visualizes our process of thinking into diagram and let gemini use it.

Each node is assigned a prompt that instructs Gemini how to perform each node.
Nodes are then interconnected with links.
Using these nodes and links, Gemini can traverse the diagram to produce the result.

By integrating with our Word File and PPT assembly nodes, we can create Word File and PPT.
We've further integrated audio generation model and image generation model into our nodes,
allowing us to assemble cutscene videos.

Even complex tasks can be easily automated.
We've created diagrams for generating Spring Boot websites and Flutter apps as well.

You can define your own diagrams to tailor automation to your specific needs.
To make diagram creation easier, we've used gemini for diagram auto-generation.
We've also automated test and diagram prompt quality evaluation using Gemini.

A community exists for sharing diagrams and feedback.
We also offer Auto Pilot, a feature that selects the most suitable diagram from verified shared diagrams to help users achieve their specific goals.

We're currently enhancing the quality of each diagram for practical use.
Our next goal is to refine self-evaluation and node generation, enabling Gemini to better emulate human thought processes.

We appreciate your time and consideration.

- ABSTRACT: Artoozy, the only positive vibe app for dedicated artists and painters

*** Description:
What it does

Artoozy is a social media android app made only for artists.
It conducts age based art contests and declare the winners in-app. It allows all the actions that a regular social media app would allow, like liking posts, chatting, general chats, reporting users/posts, contact/help, verification requests, etc. Gemini API is used in posting and general chat sections. Users can't simply add any description they want for a post or can't simply put any text in chats. The text must not be violating any ethics, religion, vulgarity, etc. Actions will be taken based on the severity of objections. Gemini API helps in regulating the sentiments and violence in these texts.
For example, when an user adds post description as "Acrylic painting of Solar System", it will be accepted. But when its added as "You are all worst, I'm the best", the app will ask the user to rethink their description due to less severity of negativity. If its added as "This is my f***ng masterpiece", this will be strictly rejected. Same principles apply in general chats, bio adding, etc.
Entire app data and user data is stored in Firebase real-time database and Firebase storage. Authentication is done in Firebase Authentication. This app is built in Android Studio.

- ABSTRACT: Known Uncertainty to Unknown Certainty

*** Description:
What it does

Our app remedies a common problem that most users of LLMs face. Many users are interested in getting recommendations for activities or exploring options that are suitable to their specific needs given their general preferences or particular circumstances at the moment when they are querying. However, they are often stuck with responses that are too generic to serve their specific needs.

A skilled human assistant would remedy this as follows: ask them pertinent questions that help them to narrow their options, and gather information that may not be directly relevant but could help understand the user's thought process. The former relates to flipped interactions and chain-of-thought prompting, which have been areas where AI has advanced significantly. The latter, on the other hand, relates to tools from cognitive psychology and behavioral analysis.

We have utilized the ability of Gemini to perform the former, where we take the user's queries and combine it with a request to perform flipped interactions. This is done through API calls. The latter is more delicate and not straightforward, and hence we have used several handpicked training examples designed using a combination of Gemini and ideas inspired by the psychology literature. Thus our model utilizes innate abilities of Gemini and questioning patterns suggested by the examples to direct the conversation with the user in a way that best extracts relevant information from the user and guides them to the desirable output.

EcoScan is an innovative recycling app that transforms the way users interact with waste. By it's advanced photo and barcode recognition technology, EcoScan instantly identifies items and provides accurate recycling instructions based on users location. This user-friendly approach simplifies the recycling process and make it easy for everyone to contribute to environmental sustainability.

Beyond recycling, EcoScan encourages positive environmental actions through features like the Litter Bingo, where users play a game by taking a picture of litter and competing to complete bingo cards. Users earn EcoCoins as rewards, which can be redeemed for sustainable products or donated to charities, which further promote the circular economy.

To enhance the app's accuracy and reach, we have integrated the Gemini API. The Gemini API significantly improves EcoScan’s ability to provide localized recycling information in countries which are unknown to the app. When users scan an item, and the app doesn't have the specific information for that location, Gemini API steps in to deliver the correct recycling guidelines tailored to local regulations. This ensures that users across the globe can confidently recycle correctly, regardless of where they are.

Incorporating the Gemini API has empowered EcoScan to provide a smarter, more comprehensive recycling solution that adapts to local needs, driving global sustainability efforts.

People often struggle to accurately assess their capabilities, leading them to create overly ambitious work plans without considering physical exhaustion. (Think about it, how many plans you made and regretted, or procrastinated.)
Daycrush helps by providing visual insights into users' appropriate workload and physical/mental state, along with personalized relaxation suggestions. It analyzes health indicators, screen time, calendar, and location data to offer insights for balancing work and personal life. The Gemini API serves two key functions: analyzing and suggesting relaxation.
1. Analysis: Gemini AI evaluates users' survey responses to identify irrational thoughts, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral. For negative responses, it determines which of the eight types of irrational thinking commonly targeted in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is present.
2. Relaxation Suggestions: Based on identified burnout symptoms and negative thoughts, Gemini AI offers personalized relaxation strategies. It uses mobile data (e.g., sleep patterns, menstrual cycles, schedules, location) to detect burnout according to DSM-5 and WHO criteria. When burnout is detected, Gemini suggests relaxation methods that address the user's anxious thoughts and align with their personal values.
These relaxation strategies are divided into five categories: physical, mental, emotional, practical, and doing nothing.

- ABSTRACT: Gemini-powered robot creating a more natural and engaging experience.

*** Description:
What it does

The integration involves several key components: the Chatbot Service, the Chatbot Bridge, the Speech Recognition Module, and the Dialogue Module. The Chatbot Service plays a crucial role by managing the entire dialogue history and generating responses based on previous interactions using the Gemini model. Specifically, the Gemini-pro model is used to generate responses. To bridge the communication gap between different programming environments, the Chatbot Bridge utilizes ZeroMQ. This component enables seamless communication between the Chatbot Service and the NaoQi extension modules. The Speech Recognition Module is, responsible for capturing audio input from the robot's microphone using the NaoQi ALAudioDevice. The audio recordings are segmented through volume thresholding. These segmented recordings are then sent to Google's cloud service for speech-to-text analysis. If the speech is successfully recognised, the resulting text is forwarded to the Chatbot Bridge.
The Dialogue Module transforms the text responses generated by Gemini into spoken language using the NaoQi ALAnimatedSpeech. This module also coordinates with the Speech Recognition Module to pause audio recordings while the robot is speaking, ensuring a turn-based dialogue system where the robot listens and responds alternately.

- TITLE: HealthyTravel  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Planning trip in an eco-friendly way

*** Description:
What it does

The app uses the Gemini API (gemini-1.5-pro-latest model). When a user plans a trip, the Gemini API is called with exposed function getLatestRegionInformation. This function allows Gemini to retrieve the latest information about the region to which the user is planning to travel (currently, only some data for Madeira are returned).
When a user plans meals for the trip, the Gemini API is also called. Here, another function, getLocalProducts, is exposed, which responds with product information such as price, carbon footprint, name, and calories. If this function responds with no data, Gemini is instructed to use its own knowledge to provide accurate information about products and, ultimately, the meals in terms of calories, carbon footprint and price (to the best of its ability) Gemini is also used to transcribe recorded audio, so users don't have to fill out entire forms manually. Instead, they can record audio, and Gemini extracts the required information from the recording.
In general, when planning trips and meals, Gemini is instructed to focus on eco-friendly approaches to minimize the carbon footprint, support local markets and support the planet, and ensure compatibility with user diet preferences and health limitations.
In addition, Gemini is used to find users with similar trip plans (the same destination, similar trip preferences and time range). When such users are found, the app sent notifications to these users via Firebase Cloud Messaging

Text Input and Fact Extraction: The user inputs text, and the app uses the Gemini API to identify and extract key factual statements.

Question Generation: The app generates questions for each fact using the Gemini API to probe their accuracy.

Cross-Referencing: The app searches online sources to verify each fact against trusted information.

Fact Verification: Based on this cross-referencing, the app determines if the original facts are accurate, misleading, or false and provides a detailed report.

By integrating the Gemini API at every step, my app ensures accurate fact extraction, question generation, and validation, making it a powerful tool for automated fact-checking.

- TITLE: WebA11y (pronounced Web Ally)  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: WebA11y: Your personal all-in-one web Accessibility Enhancer

*** Description:
What it does

The app is a Chromium browser-based extension that when installed, has the ability to alter the alt text of all the supported images on the web page it is used in. Most web accessibility fixes depend on the developers of culprit websites following best practices and making necessary changes. However, some developers simply might not care, and people should not be punished for things beyond their control.

WebA11y plans to give some of that control back to the users of the internet. The first step is in fixing the most common violation: "non-existent or unsuitable alternative text for images." With a simple click of a button, WebA11y does absolute "magic" for image alt texts, and it is powered completely by the Gemini API. The best part? This is just the start of WebA11y, and more AI features will be coming in waves.

How I used the Gemini API? To the users of WebA11y, it looks like magic. In reality, Gemini does the heavy lifting. Each individual image URL and accompanying alt text from the web page's HTML are sent to Gemini to both assess and either keep (if suitable) or replace (if unsuitable or blank). Gemini does this in very quick time, and sends the output back. WebA11y then rewrites the alt attribute with the results returned from Gemini.

Nimbus exposes a chat interface for the user where it is possible to at/@ files and get an autocomplete dropdown widget with all the different files in the desktop environment. Selected files are passed to the Gemini API for processing. Messages and files are saved to Firebase Firestore. Nimbus also uses Gemini’s Function Calling to let the model determine when it needs to run code in the local desktop environment. However, no code runs without the user’s explicit consent. Nimbus displays the code from the Gemini Function Call first and runs it only if user consent is given. This approach allows users to leverage the full potential of LLMs while safeguarding their systems.

*** Description:
What it does

One out of every ten people worldwide is affected by dyslexia. In the United States, one in five students faces this challenge. We believe that everyone should be able to benefit from AI technologies. So we created PhotoChat to bring AI into the everyday lives of people with dyslexia. Using Gemini, prompts are now written for you.

Photochat predicts which questions you like to ask using Gemini Flash, so you don't have to formulate the question by yourself. It then answers your questions with Gemini Pro and predicts relevant follow-up questions.

1. The user takes a photo or video
2. Gemini Flash generates three relevant questions
3. The user picks or edits one of them
3. Gemini Pro answers the question, and the user receives it in the chat
5. A follow-up question is suggested by Gemini Flash

To generate high-quality questions, PhotoChat leverages an extensive, 10000+ character prompt. It categorizes the photo in one of 64 different ways to process it optimally and get the best results.

PhotoChat also supports image editing. Gemini Flash converts the user prompt into a search and replace format, which is then used to edit the image with Stable Diffusion.

Gemini predicts the questions that you’d like to ask. This way, you can deep dive into any topic without being an expert. Gemini guides you by asking relevant follow-up questions, even those you wouldn’t have thought of.

We have made sure that all chat messages are fully compatible with the native screen reader.

Questle? is a word puzzle game. It is similar to the Wordle type games, with a different challenge being released every day. The basics of the game are quite simple. There is a secret word that the user is trying to identify by asking the model yes or no questions. The user has 20 questions to find the word. Gemini 1.5 flash was used; however, other models might work better. A simple prompt was provided to the model explaining the purpose of the game. Each time a new question was asked, the entire conversation was sent to the model to provide the model context. This game was used as a simple proof of concept in using AI for puzzle-based games and its potential to influence such a large area. Puzzle based games have not changed much and this could possibly open an entire new genre of web-based gaming. As a fresh graduate developer, many insights were learned from using AI in this fashion. Including the strengths and weaknesses of the technology.

- ABSTRACT: Vizzy Brain makes reading stress-free for dyslexic learners.

*** Description:
What it does

"Vizzy Brain" is a web app designed to help people, especially those with dyslexia, learn in a way that’s easier and less stressful. Dyslexia makes it hard for some people to read and understand long texts, which can cause anxiety and fatigue. Vizzy Brain solves this by turning information into visual mind maps instead of long paragraphs.


With Vizzy Brain, users can ask questions, summarize long texts, or even summarize books. Instead of giving a long text answer, the app creates a mind map that grows step-by-step as the user learns, with short explanations on the side. Users can easily navigate through their knowledge using simple keyboard keys, and they can look back at what they've learned anytime.


The app works thanks to the Gemini API, which helps Vizzy Brain turn user questions and texts into small, easy-to-understand pieces of information. These pieces are then turned into a visual mind map using a javascript library called the Mermaid. Gemini also helps generate the code and format needed to display the mind map clearly.


In short, Vizzy Brain makes learning more accessible and less overwhelming by using visual tools to present information in a way that’s easy to understand. It’s designed to help people learn better and feel more confident in their abilities.

What it does

This is an idle game.
We're experimenting with gemini during development.
1. I've tried adding chat through gemini.
I added it as a test to have fun with AI chat when there are no users in the game.
2. gemini selects a pre-made AI pattern, explains the status of the selected AI pattern, and explains the strategy for it.
3. It recommends AI skills. Since we are a game where skill is the main objective, it helps you win the game by recommending AI skills when you lose a boss battle or AI battle.
Unlike field monsters, AI monsters will either continue to run away or become invulnerable for 30 seconds and roam the field.

The game is in development and may contain bugs, The nature of the game requires a lot of level design tables, and with GEMINI, I think we will be able to design game levels without tables in the future.

*** Description:
What it does

The app uses Gemini Api to get the coordinates of the PIIs in an image and then redact them in a way where they can be unredacted. Using normal image viewer, the image will then appear with the PIIs redacted.

It also uses the Gemini Api to get the PIIs in an image and sends the coordinates to a web service to allows for redaction and unredaction of the data in the image.

It also uses the Gemini Api to test and see if the image contains data that has been redacted.

The sample image I used is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_passport

- ABSTRACT: Gain insights and clarity for your emotional well-being

*** Description:
What it does

Our Emotion Analyzer app is tool designed to help users gain deeper insights into their emotional state using advanced AI technology. Here's how it works and how we've integrated the Gemini API:

The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface where users can input their current feelings and thoughts. Once the user submits their input, our app leverages the Gemini API to perform a comprehensive analysis of the expressed emotions.

We utilize the Gemini API through the Google Generative AI package in Dart. The process begins by initializing a GenerativeModel with specific configurations tailored for emotion analysis. We set parameters like temperature, topK, and topP to fine-tune the AI's response generation.

The app sends the user's input to the Gemini model along with a carefully crafted prompt. This prompt instructs the AI to:

1. Extract and list key emotions from the user's input.
2. Provide a brief summary of the overall emotional state.
3. Offer a supportive message based on the analyzed emotions.
4. Respond in a personal, empathetic tone.

The Gemini API processes this request and returns a structured response. Our app then displays this response to the user, presenting:

- A list of identified emotions
- A concise summary of their emotional state
- A supportive message tailored to their current feelings

By leveraging the Gemini API's natural language processing capabilities, our app provides users with AI-driven emotional insights.

What it does

Our app lets users and Gemini craft stories interactively together. Users create one scene, and the Gemini generates another. Each scene will grow the story plot bigger and better. Moreover, each agent needs to provide setup for the other to follow, making the story more specific and interesting.

We use Gemini to assist in generating these setups and writing the story. While we encourage users to write their own stories, they can also use the AI to help fill in details if they prefer.

Each scene includes an image created by an image generation model. Gemini’s multi-modal capabilities ensure that the image fits the scene and story using auto-critic mechanism. One Gemini creates the image prompt, which is then used by the image generator. Another Gemini evaluates the generated image and gives feedback to the first Gemini to refine and improve the prompt for better results.

*** Description:
What it does

Inspiration:
The rapid growth of industries has increased pollution, leading to more health issues. With limited access to doctors, it’s vital for people to be informed about health. Our app helps users to manage their health by providing medical information.
About the Project:
The goal of MediAssist is to create a medical app to help users manage minor health issues. It offers three key features: medication identification through image recognition, an AI doctor powered by Google’s Gemini API for answering health questions, and a calendar with reminders for health tasks. How do we build our project:
We researched applying Gemini to medicine image understanding and chatbots, and gathered Vietnamese medical data using bots and human workers. We fine-tuned the model, and optimized it with Few-Shot prompting.
Our AI doctor app uses a Python-based AI chatbot with Google Generative AI for model tuning and RESTful APIs. The Gemini 1.0 Pro model processes input from the React Native front end. For medication identification, images are converted to base64 and analyzed by the Gemini 1.5 Pro model. Medication names are matched in our database, and results are sent back to the front end. The Create Calendar feature allows users to set reminders for medication, with notifications managed through Docker containerized backend services. All components are built with React Native and integrated with push notifications.

This description is then transformed into a visual representation of the arena, setting the stage for the combat.

During the battle, players receive support from two AI assistants: a tactician and a fighter. The tactician uses the Gemini API to analyze the battlefield and opponents, offering strategic advice for the next move. The fighter then uses this advice, along with the player’s input, to generate a move, which is executed in the game. After each round, the AI referee, also powered by Gemini, evaluates the combat actions and assigns scores based on performance.

Finally, a commentator assistant provides a detailed analysis and commentary on the battle in the game's chat, helping players and spectators understand the strategic choices made. Through the integration of the Gemini API, AI Arena delivers a dynamic and immersive experience, making each game session unique and engaging.

*** Description:
What it does

Imagine stepping outside, unsure of how to choose the right outfit, or being at a joyful gathering, unable to appreciate descriptions in photos taken with friends. For those who can see, these are simple, everyday experiences. But for blind people, these moments are filled with uncertainty. Creating a memory album, or knowing the weather, or sensing activity in a park on a summer day—these are experiences many take for granted.

This is what myAIs offers.

myAIs is an Android app that turns visual experiences into words for blind users. Powered by AI, the app captures images and converts them into detailed verbal descriptions. Whether identifying objects, reading text, or describing the atmosphere of a lively environment, myAIs uses advanced technology to make the unseen accessible.

The app also lets users save these moments, creating a personal collection of audible visual memories. Supported by Gemini, these descriptions are not only accurate but also enhance the user’s connection with the world.

myAIs offers blind and visually impaired users a new way to experience life’s details—through the lens of Gemini.

Despite being a solo developer, my motivation is boundless in creating an accessible assistant for those who need it most. Driven by the belief that technology can bridge gaps and create opportunities for the visually impaired, myAIs is just the beginning of this journey, contributing to a more inclusive world, one innovation at a time.

- TITLE: Youtube AI study app  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Quiz yourself, summarise and chat to your youtube videos

*** Description:
What it does

My app that was developed in react native allows you to quiz yourself on youtube videos, chat to the video transcript content and gives you an intelligent summary where you can click and play at different points.

Gemini was used for the intelligent summary by create a prompt that accepts a transcript with MM:SS timestamps. From here I defined a json schema I expect back from gemini. It turned out to be very reliable and was able to parse this expected output in the react native application I developed, using these MM:SS timestamps at points to seek to the correct time in the Youtube player on the app. Gemini long context window was crucial. It could handle 5 hours of video transcript no problem

For the Q&A screen similarly after experimenting with different prompts and json schemas I settled on a multiple choice question and answer with that Gemini returned with the correct answer too. From here I was able to use this json response to build an interactive multiple choice question based entirely on the transcript of the video. This wouldn't have been easy with Gemini. Also implemented a refresh for different number of Q&A.

Lastly implemented a chat screen tab where we can chat to the video transcript and ask whatever questions we might have while studying the video and trying to learn more. This leveraged the powerful knowledge already existing with gemini along with the context of the video transcript.

Firebase hosting, functions and database were used too.

- ABSTRACT: Motion Magic is the all-in-one physics education tool.

*** Description:
What it does

Motion Magic was created to solve a critical problem in physics education: the need for reliable, on-demand, step-by-step solutions that students can trust. In a world where online resources are often behind paywalls or lack accuracy, Motion Magic leverages advanced AI to deliver precise answers.

The app leverages Gemini for the AI solver, processing physics problems by prompting Gemini in a specific format. Gemini returns a JSON that includes the problem text, set of known values, and an array of steps. Each step contains the equation to use, the variable to solve for, and the explanation.

To address the limitations of LLMs in complex math computations, our app handles all calculations internally. This approach ensures accurate results and reduces response time.

As the JSON data is being streamed, it's processed in real-time. This means that instead of waiting until receiving the entire response, the app begins displaying processed problem text, variables, and steps as soon as enough data is available. This way, the app can display step 1 within 3 to 4 secs, rather than waiting 10 to 12 secs for the entire response. This method enhances the user experience by providing fast and accurate solutions.

Beyond the AI solver, Motion Magic offers a wide range of physics tools, including physics simulations and a note-taking mode. This allows students to visualize concepts and organize their studies all in one place.

Motion Magic will revolutionize the way of physics learning.

*** Description:
What it does

My app is designed to assist individuals who are lactose intolerant by accurately identifying and categorizing foods based on their lactose content. Using the Gemini API from Google, the app first analyzes images of food items, recognizing them with high accuracy and speed. This recognition process is crucial as it ensures the app can correctly identify a wide variety of foods, forming the foundation of its functionality.

Once the food is identified, the app provides detailed information about it. The Gemini API also plays a critical role in assessing the lactose risk of the food. I developed specific criteria for five risk categories: nonexistent, low, medium, high, and very high. The app uses these criteria to categorize each food item accurately into one of these risk levels. While the image recognition and information retrieval are reliable, I noticed some challenges with strict adherence to the specific risk criteria. Despite this, the app effectively helps users avoid foods that could trigger their lactose intolerance.

In summary, my app leverages the Gemini API's robust image recognition and risk assessment capabilities to identify foods quickly and categorize their lactose risk accurately. This ensures that users can make informed dietary choices with confidence.

- TITLE: HamaraLabs- Enable Experiential Learning  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Enable hands-on learning by generating customised tinkering activities

*** Description:
What it does

Atal Tinkering labs (ATL) setup by NITI-Aayog, Govt. of India are maker spaces for high school students to do hands-on-activities. 10,000 ATLs are set up catering to around 10 million students. ATL contains educational and learning do-it-yourself kits and equipment on science, electronics, robotics, open-source microcontroller boards, sensors, 3D printers and computers.
With the vast amount of information available online, ATL students today may have access to resources on how to perform various hands-on activities, but they often face the challenge of choosing what specific tinkering activity to pursue among the myriad options. This decision paralysis is leading to confusion and inaction, hindering their ability to engage in experiential learning.
HamaraLabs is a web app developed to generate customised and personalised tinkering activities for students doing experiential learning.
Here is an example of series of customised tinkering activities generated :
Initial tinkering activity assigned - Use solar energy to light an LED.
Customised tinkering activities generated by Gemini API - 1.Use solar energy to run a DC motor 2.Use solar energy to light an LED and run a DC motor controlled by a switch 3.Use solar energy to light an LED and run a DC motor, connect two solar panels in series
..
n.Use solar energy generated from 1 kW solar panels to run 3 computers, 2 tube lights and 2 fans. We used Gemini API's written in Node js and hosted in firebase cloud functions.

- TITLE: Automated Image-Based Measurement Tool  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Automated Image-Based Measurement Tool for Nano Devices

*** Description:
What it does

Transistors are essential components in integrated circuits, where their performance depends on their structure and material composition. Recently, conventional silicon-based CMOS logic devices have encountered technical and physical limitations. Consequently, many research teams are exploring new semiconductor materials to advance the field.
Our project aimed to develop an artificial intelligence model to assess the quality of channel samples obtained during the exfoliation step, which is critical in the fabrication process of semiconductor devices based on novel materials. Traditionally, these channel samples are observed under an optical microscope or Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and their width is measured manually using scientific image measurement software.
However, we have designed a website that utilizes the Gemini API and image processing techniques to automate this process. Users can upload target photos to the API and immediately receive information about the width of the channels and the suitability of the samples for device fabrication. Plus, We also created and trained our own datasets for segmentation models based on the UNet architecture. We believe this innovation will greatly benefit research teams working on nano devices based on novel semiconductor materials, providing them with significant convenience.

- ABSTRACT: AI Shift is a web app that automates and optimizes shift scheduling.

*** Description:
What it does

AI Shift is a web app that automates and optimizes shift scheduling. Simply input your complex workplace rules, and it will generate shifts that meet both employee preferences and operational needs, considering factors like interpersonal relationships and individual circumstances that traditional methods often struggle to handle.

Shift creation has long been a complex challenge in workforce management. Traditional mathematical optimization methods simply allocate staff numbers to meet basic requirements. However, they cannot handle complex workplace constraints like interpersonal factors, individual preferences, or nuanced company policies.
Moreover, relying solely on generative AI for shift creation also presents challenges. While AI excels at understanding shift rules, it struggles with aggregating data and performing the type of mathematical optimizations that traditional methods handle well.

To address these limitations, we've implemented a hybrid Chain-of-Thought method, where non-AI code performs the statistical analysis that AI typically struggles with, and feeds this aggregated data back to the AI. AI Shift overcomes these limitations through this hybrid approach that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with specialized non-AI algorithms.

AI Shift uses Gemini in 3 steps:
1. Generate initial shifts from user input.
2. Refine shifts by adding statistical analysis data by non-AI algorithm.
3. Validate shifts against workplace rules.

NutriNinja is an Android app that helps users identify harmful ingredients in food products and find healthier alternatives. The app has three main sections: profile, scanning, and history. Users can securely set up a profile by signing in with email, Google, or Facebook and selecting dietary restrictions—which guide personalized recommendations.

NutriNinja scans food products in four ways: by barcode, ingredient label, grocery item, or fast-food item. It uses the Google GMS Barcode Scanner for barcode scanning and the Google GMS Document Scanner to find and isolate the ingredient labels. For grocery items and fast-food products, NutriNinja relies on the Gemini API.

Gemini identifies the top five most likely items in the user’s picture and prompts the user to select the correct product. Once selected, Gemini evaluates the safety of the product’s ingredients, provides reasons why certain ingredients are harmful, considers the user’s dietary restrictions, and suggests healthier alternatives.

All scanned products are saved in the user's history, securely stored in Firestore, and easily accessible within the History tab for tracking. All in all, NutriNinja is a personalized tool that helps users make healthier food choices by integrating advanced scanning and the Gemini API. It provides a layor of novelty by incorporating profiling systems and the ability to scan items without barcodes.

*** Description:
What it does

My app is designed for Knowledge Representation and Insights Generation from Structured Datasets. It streamlines data analysis by offering tools for preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization. The app uses a logistic regression model for income prediction due to its high accuracy and provides an intuitive interface for data overview and visualization.

A key feature of the app is its query bot, initially powered by Google PaLM2 API integrated with LangChain. This setup allowed users to interact with the data through natural language queries, translating them into actionable data operations. However, after PaLM2 was deprecated, so I had to switch to using the Gemini API (model = gemini-pro). The transition maintained the app’s ability to handle natural language queries effectively.

With PandasAI interpreting the queries and Gemini executing the data operations, users can still generate downloadable CSVs or visualizations from their queries. This query bot enhances the app's accessibility, enabling users to derive insights from their data without needing advanced technical skills. The seamless integration of these advanced AI tools ensures the app remains both powerful and user-friendly, providing an efficient way to convert natural language into actionable data-driven insights.

*** Description:
What it does

Kosmos is a unique app that allows you to explore and interact with astrology like never before. The app takes a super fresh and creative approach to astrology. The magic is in the creativity & interpretations provided by Gemini. I provided a thorough context of ancient and modern Hellenistic astrological principles along with a huge depth of context to ensure that the readings, haikus and affirmations are consistent & remarkably insightful.

Gemini creates poetic haikus, inspiring thoughts and affirmations for every cosmic moment. Gemini also provides symbolic titles, key themes and a thorough insightful interpretation for every planet placement and astrological aspect. Gemini has blown me away with its nuanced & deep interpretations. For further details on specific usage of Gemini please see the README.md file in the root of the project. At the moment I'm using Gemini to create Hellenistic content but plan to expand to Indian Vedic, Chinese Bazi and more.

I've obsessed over the apps performance & use interpolation to provide animated astrological visualisations.

I started this project 7 weeks ago as a total astrology novice, Gemini has been my astrology mentor. I even loaded the context window up with the 200 page Swiss Ephemeris documentation & SDK, which it would expertly advise me on.

Gemini has supercharged me as a creative, I would never have been able to accomplish all of this without Gemini.

The web application generates multiple choice questions using Gemini and evaluates user's responses. The user can either select an existing topic, enter a new topic, or upload a pdf document. In the backend, Gemini chatbot is prompted to generate questions on the topic or the parsed uploaded document, with 4 multiple-choice options, the correct answer option, and an explanation of the answer. To validate the veracity of the generated answer, each generated question is asked as an input to the chatbot and the response is compared to the answer generated along with the original generated question. Validated questions with the 4 options are shown to the user, and the User Interface tracks the performance of the user over the question-set. For the test preparation section - GRE verbal reasoning and SAT Critical Reading and Comprehension, the chatbot is prompted to generate a passage and ask multiple-choice questions based on the passage. This can help both students with practice as well as examiners with question-setting.

"Our app transforms medical reports into Smart Reports by integrating the user profile with test results or biomarkers, generating a health infographic with visualisations and actionable insights. The core of our system is a reasoning engine, which processes this data to create the Smart Report.

We leverage the Gemini LLM in two key ways:

First, we extract and map the test information from source PDF into Medicus Biomarkers, preparing the data for further analysis by our reasoning engine.

Second, we use the Gemini LLM to answer user questions about their reports. To enhance the accuracy of these responses, we supply the LLM with the Smart Report content and a list of credible sources from Medicus. This approach minimises the risk of hallucinations in the LLM's answers, ensuring reliable and accurate user support."

- ABSTRACT: Qwiksift speeds hiring by filtering resumes with AI preferences.

*** Description:
What it does

Qwiksift is currently in its MVP stage, built with Python (Django DRF) and React JS. The platform serves as an advanced ATS, enabling admins to post jobs through the Django admin interface. We leverage the Gemini API (gemini-1.5-pro-latest) to analyze job posts, extracting key details like job title, employer, skills, and qualifications. The Gemini API assigns weights to these factors, which are combined with custom algorithmic weights to help filter and rank resumes effectively.

When candidates apply, their resumes are parsed using Gemini LLM, and the extracted data is stored in a PostgreSQL database. For instance, if 100 candidates apply for a job, Qwiksift filters and ranks the top 20% based on the combined weights. Admins can then refine these candidates further by applying custom preferences, such as specific skills or location (e.g., Python, LLMs, NLP, and New York, USA).

The Gemini LLM, along with our custom algorithm, is then used to score candidates against these preferences, enhancing accuracy. Elasticsearch supports advanced searching, and the system re-ranks the candidates based on the new scores. Admins can apply up to 7 different filters to score and rank resumes, with the option to download the filtered results for further review.

- ABSTRACT: Turn toy photos into fun and educational stories for children

*** Description:
What it does

Zentale is an Android app that converts toy photos into fun and educational stories using the Google Gemini Ai Api.
How does the app work?
Users can log in to Zentale using their Google account. With the One Tap Compose library, sign-in takes less than 2 seconds. If this is the first time the user logs in, I have a Firebase onCreate function in the back end that auto-assigns text story credits to each account.
Once logged in, users can convert a toy photo into a text story in the following simple steps:
1. Take a new toy photo or add one from the gallery.
Optional: Select the output language for the story. Currently, you can select from English, Spanish, and Romanian. If you don t select any story will be in English
2. Press on Create Story and wait for the creation.
In the background, when users tap on the "Create story" button, here's what happens:
-Adds the toy photo to Firebase Storage, which returns an image url
- I send the image URL to my Node JS Api, which uses the Gemini Ai Api.
Gemini-1.5-flash converts the image to a story title. Then, I use the title to create the story content by calling the same model.
- Once Gemini creates the story, it saves it to Firestore.
- When the Android app receives a successful response, I use the story id to fetch the story from Firestore.

- ABSTRACT: Our app revitalizes local communities by fostering social interactions

*** Description:
What it does

Our app leverages the advanced capabilities of the Gemini API to categorize user-shared posts, a complex task beyond human capability and rendered ineffective if left to user discretion. This sophisticated categorization process identifies potential interest groups based on geographical location, ensuring that each post reaches the most relevant audience. While our app shares structural similarities with traditional social networks, its core mission is distinct: to promote real-world interactions over digital ones. To achieve this, the app intentionally limits in-app communication to encourage users to engage face-to-face.

Additionally, our app is designed to foster both new and existing relationships. The friend feed feature, which is geographically constrained, selectively showcases posts from individuals whom users have chosen to keep in close contact with. This helps maintain strong, personal connections regardless of physical distances.

A key feature of our app is its ability to reconnect users with friends who have geographically drifted apart. It does this by highlighting exceptional proximity alerts, notifying users when a long-lost friend is unexpectedly nearby.

This local focus encourages users to engage more with their immediate environment, potentially leading to increased support for local businesses and economies, thereby reinforcing the ecological benefits of consuming locally and sustaining community-based initiatives.

- TITLE: Wizard Magic Tower & Designer Pal.  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Your Ultimate Design Companion.

*** Description:
What it does

I was inspired to create two innovative apps, Wizard Designer Pal and Wizard Magic Tower, as a business case for Canva, recognizing a gap in their marketplace for tools that blend creativity with AI-driven functionality. Canva, known for its user-friendly design tools, currently lacks apps that deeply integrate generative AI to simplify complex design tasks, and I aimed to fill that void.

Wizard Designer Pal: serves as a personal design assistant, particularly for those new to graphic design or keen on learning more. The app uses the Gemini API to offer advanced features like color theory guidance, accessibility checks (including color blindness simulation), and AI-driven background recommendations. The Gemini API’s multimodal capabilities allow the app to perform detailed image analyses and generate accurate textual descriptions, ensuring that designs are not only aesthetically pleasing but also inclusive and accessible.

Wizard Magic Tower, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for graphic designers who want to add a touch of magic to their work. This app allows users to create and modify backgrounds, add unique frames, and generate AI-driven image variations, among other creative tasks. It’s like having a personal design wizard at your fingertips. The Gemini API plays a crucial role here as well, enabling the generation of high-quality images based on text prompts and enhancing the app’s ability to create complex visual elements with ease.

- ABSTRACT: Predict Soda Consumption to fight Kidney Failure.

*** Description:
What it does

I fine-tuned Gemini with a government dataset. dataset was processed: feature engineering, tests, etc. I combined my fine-tuned Gemini with ARIMA and XGboost models to create an Ensemble of 3 models. This brought down my MAE to about 6. At first I was getting predictions from all US states but that was a lot of API data requests-which slowed down the website. But fine-tuned Gemini did very well predicting soda consumption for all states alone. The fine-Gemini did very well with predictions but with a very high MAE. So ARIMA and XGBOOST was mostly used to bring down the MAE significantly, but the fine-tuned Gemini alone was already producing great forecasting soda consumption results when compared the original government dataset. So the real power in soda consumption predictions comes from fine-tuned Gemini. Texas is where I had my surgery to donate my kidney to my father because of his Kidney Failure. So its nice to focus on Texas future soda consumption to tackle the kidney issues here. Now that we are aware of soda consumption, we can ask people to anonymously/voluntarily donate a urine test which is the best tool to measure Stage 1 Kidney Failure. Stage 5 kidney failure is already too late, and people need surgery at Stage 5. So with soda consumption predictions, we can focus on Stage 1, prevention approach. Kill Kidney Failure at its root. I used Vertex AI an GCP Cloud Run/Load Balancer. I used Chrome dev tools to check latency API issues.

What it does

Traditional multiple-choice tests fall short in assessing the full scope of a student's understanding and critical thinking abilities, relying heavily on memorization and not truly testing the skills needed for real-world application. In response, RoboGrade.io was developed to revolutionize the classroom testing landscape by replacing outdated methods with a web app designed to enhance teaching effectiveness and student learning.

This web app utilizes the Gemini LLM to automate the grading of free-response questions, ensuring accurate and fair assessments while providing detailed, personalized feedback to students. This feedback is designed to help students understand their strengths and weaknesses more clearly, promoting a deeper and more reflective learning process. As a student myself, I often did not receive much feedback, if any, for the many tests I have taken in the past. This app provides the feedback needed for growth.

By reducing the time teachers spend on grading, AI-Graded Tests allow educators to focus more on instructional activities and individual student support. This shift enhances educational quality, making learning environments more engaging and supportive.

*** Description:
What it does

One of the core features is the integration of the Gemini model, which facilitates multilingual chat in English, Tamil, and Sinhala. Since Sinhala is not natively supported by Gemini, we’ve paired it with a translation service to ensure smooth and accurate communication in all three languages. This enables our diverse user base in Sri Lanka to interact seamlessly within the app.

To maintain a safe and relevant marketplace, we’ve implemented image recognition technology that automatically filters out unwanted ads, ensuring that only appropriate content is posted. Additionally, our image search function allows users to easily find specific products, and we’ve enhanced product descriptions using the Gemini model, which provides richer, AI-generated details to improve user understanding and engagement.

Further supporting both users and farmers, we’ve developed a vegetable and fruit price prediction model that forecasts prices for the coming week. This helps users make informed purchasing decisions and allows farmers to plan their sales strategies more effectively.

- ABSTRACT: Never run out of practice questions for major Korean tests

*** Description:
What it does

Korean language learners have limited options to practice for standardized Korean language tests, the most common one being books with past tests. These books often fail to prepare the reader effectively for Korean reading questions as, by including only past questions of the last few tests, they do not offer enough variety to practice a wide range of topics that were not seen in previous tests but could end up in the next test. Korean Test Companion addresses this lack of variety by letting the user generate questions based on original texts to practice for common Korean language tests. It uses Gemini to generate texts based on topics chosen by the user, and questions about the generated texts. The prompts Gemini receives ensure the question and level are similar to previous questions of a common Korean test. It also uses Gemini to detect difficult words in the generated texts and provide definitions that are contextually relevant, helping the user learn new words about topics they are less familiar with. The user can also save texts and bookmark difficult words for later reference. The application is currently fine tuned for one specific question type on short texts, mimicking the question type of a popular test. In the future, the application will have more question types, allow users to input their own texts, and track users' progress on the number of questions they have answered correctly.

- ABSTRACT: Read books with no fluff, no filler—just the good stuff.

*** Description:
What it does

We've designed an intuitive and visually appealing User Interface that organizes the key concepts of books into what we call "concept bubbles." These bubbles allow users to easily select and explore the essential ideas of a book.An when a user want to slect more concept bubbles, there is a tab that opens a screen where every concept are laid out similar to a table of contents, where they can browse and choose other key concepts. Selected concepts will have an subtle indicator so user can know what concept they haven't gone through yet.
Once a concept is selected, it triggers or prompt Gemini (powered by Gemini API) to provide a concise and focused explanation of that idea. Our goal is to address the common issue of having too much to read and too little time and having to get through blocks and blocks of text in traditional reading or listening to audiobooks before getting to the core of a concept in a book, we would like to eliminate this unnecessary fluff and filler, so users can get straight to the core ideas, stories, concepts. With this approach, you can learn from books with no fluff, no filler—just the good stuff.

- TITLE: Azang (아장)  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Baby healthcare AI application for gut health

*** Description:
What it does

We try to expand the healthcare infrastructure to protect babies worldwide through this application. While many caregivers focus on fever since babies are vulnerable to it, digestive issues in babies are also important because they are closely linked to growth and are often harder to detect as symptoms and warning signs. Digestive problems are one of the most common abnormalities that babies and can sometimes indicate serious conditions such as biliary atresia or intussusception.

To help caregivers respond more wisely, we have innovated baby tracking app with the Gemini API. We have developed a chatbot service that detects health issues in babies based on records of meals and bowel movements made while raising them. Depending on the baby's health, factors such as stool color, consistency, and mucus can vary significantly, and the analysis must consider the foods consumed previously. We have designed a search-augmented generative language model trained on around 2,000 medical paper abstracts, and with Gemini, we have produced highly accurate results. Through our service, caregivers can take actions such as visiting a hospital or adjusting the baby's diet, and receive detailed information on potential illnesses to watch out for. This marks the birth of an innovative AI app that not only records but also proactively analyzes data.

*** Description:
What it does

The humble nurse app is a resource tool for nurses. The way I used Gemini API is with medications and debriefing. The medication use is simple, nurses can enter in a medication they want to search and are able to get a detailed answer back. The Debriefing portion allows nurses to talk with Gemini and express their emotions after a traumatic event, in order to vent and to assist in the grieving process. Being a nurse myself I found it difficult that nursing rarely allows a debriefing after a patient has passed away. I thought by allowing nurses a tool on their phone to speak to, to give them some outlet would be a benefit to their (our) mental health. I'm not a developer or coder. I work as a nurse for the past 13 years and mainly in the ICU. I always enjoyed technology, teaching and nursing. I thought this would be a great way to help my colleagues. Thanks for creating the Gemini as I just integrated it into the app. I hope to polish the app more with help. Sincerely,

*** Description:
What it does

As a UT Austin Computer Science student, I noticed the chaos of subleasing scattered across platforms including GroupMe, Instagram, Facebook Marketplace, Discord, FurnishFinder, and more. To solve this, I created Subleasier, a centralized hub for college students to easily find and sublease apartments.

When a sublessor creates a listing, Gemini analyzes the property's details through a multimodal input (text descriptions and images) to provide fair market value estimates. This empowers sublessees to make informed decisions by comparing the listed price to market rates. Additionally, Gemini generates objective apartment descriptions, offering unbiased insights alongside the sublessor's perspective.

Sublessees can also engage in natural language conversations with a Gemini-powered chat function. They can describe their requirements in words instead of being limited by traditional search filters like dropdown menus, checkboxes, and sliders. Gemini efficiently identifies and presents the most suitable listings.

Gemini is an integral component of Subleasier, generating comprehensive apartment summaries, accurately determine fair market values for properties, offer advanced search capabilities based on natural language queries, and provide real-time recommendations tailored to individual preferences.

Through these innovative features, Subleasier is setting a new standard for the subleasing market, delivering exceptional value and convenience to college students.

*** Description:
What it does

Some kids are shy, or experience other social difficulties that deter them from making friends in the real world. Sometimes it’s easier to interact with other kids using an anonymous chat app, where they are less exposed.
However, the internet can be a dangerous place.
In order to overcome these obstacles, „Treehouse“ chat app uses Gemini‘s capabilities in the following ways: Camp counselors - male and female chatbots with unique personas, that are there to answer the kids’ questions, provide orientation and entertainment and teach the kids social skills. Sentiment recognition: The app categorizes the kids’ messages by sentiment. Certain sentiments trigger actions - offensive and inappropriate messages are blocked immediately. if the child sends distressed messages for a predefined duration a message is sent to the parent. If the child sends bored messages for a predefined period of time a camp counselor joins the room and suggests activities.
language comprehension: if the messages include information that can compromise the kid’s privacy and put them in risk, the message is blocked. If the kid asks the counselors to arrange a meeting with a friend outside the app, a message is sent to the parent of the child with the email address of the other child’s parent, so they could organize a meeting between their kids safely.

GemLingua, an AI-driven application, caters to global learners, irrespective of their English proficiency. With only 25% of the global population being native English speakers, it's crucial to have a flexible language learning app that provides immediate, necessary information, rather than making users wait to complete a course.
The app features predefined prompts related to language learning goals and motivations. It offers course prompts for 178 languages, which users can modify before asking Gemini to generate content. Users can request more chapter details based on follow-up actions.
A multilingual dictionary is a key component of GemLingua. Users can search for a word, and the app compares the results from a free dictionary.dev public API with Gemini's offerings. This feature enables users to compare a word across all their goal languages.
The My Vocabulary feature allows users to add words or sentences to their vocabulary. Plans for a "magic button" feature to enhance "My Vocabulary" couldn't be completed due to time constraints.
Lastly, Gemlingua features a powerful quick access search bar for any prompts. For example, users planning to travel can ask for all the necessary travel-related words. This makes Gemlingua a comprehensive, user-friendly language learning tool. It has dark light theme and Speech to text on any text selection for accessibility.

The Ars Magna et Ultima project is a revolutionary approach to the automatic discovery of interesting questions.

Current research focuses on the known unknowns, those problems that we know exist, although we do not know how to solve them. Ars Magna enables us to uncover questions in the realm of the unknown unknowns. These are problems for which not only are the solutions unknown, but the problems themselves have not yet been identified. By creatively combining existing topics from different areas of knowledge and applying generative artificial intelligence to these combinations, we can discover new research topics.

Our goal is to bring the research of the future into the present.

We start with a vast database, every scientific page on Wikipedia, organized by categories, and characterized by novel metrics. For example, relevance measures how many people are affected by a given problem. And maturity quantifies how well we understand the different elements that compose a research topic. By integrating these dimensions, Ars Magna, with the help of the generative AI, can identify where the most fertile ground lies for groundbreaking questions.

In conclusion, Ars Magna is more than an application to foster creativity; it is a new paradigm for knowledge discovery in the age of artificial intelligence.

- TITLE: Slovo AI  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Learn English through fun, smart conversations with instant feedback

*** Description:
What it does

Slovo AI is an innovative app designed to make learning English engaging and accessible through interactive dialogues with a bot. Unlike traditional language learning apps, Slovo AI offers a low barrier to practice English, providing users with two options for each response — one correct and one incorrect — making it easier to learn and make progress without feeling overwhelmed. Users can chat about topics they enjoy, keeping the learning experience relevant and fun, while receiving instant grammar explanations to understand their mistakes and improve quickly.

How I used the Gemini API:

1. Conversational AI: Gemini API powers the bot, acting as a character that users interact with, making role-playing conversations feel natural and dynamic.

2. Response Suggestions: The API suggests the next response for the user, ensuring that the conversation flows smoothly and is easy to continue.

3. Text Corruption: To introduce grammatical challenges, the Gemini API generates corrupted responses, adding intentional errors for users to learn from.

4. Grammar Explanations: The API provides clear explanations of grammar errors in the user’s native language, helping them understand and correct their mistakes.

5. Translation: Gemini API translates text into the user’s native language, making the app accessible to learners from various linguistic backgrounds.

*** Description:
What it does

Moom is an AI architecture and interior design kit that puts the focus on people who live in the space. Typically, image generation with generative AI requires a text prompt and it often lacks scale interpretation. In the design workflow, visual communication helps convey concepts effectively and bridges the gap in interpretation. Moom integrates 2D image generation with a 3D model to enhance scale accuracy. To construct the 3D model, we use Gemini API to search our 3D model database that matches user needs and visual input.
The Gemini API extracts significant features from each furniture piece in the database and from the user's moodboard, which consists of a set of images. Currently, we focus on “overall mood and tone” and “color” as the main attributes. These features are then embedded using a text-embedding model. Gemini is used to suggest furniture categories based on users input, such as age range and specific requirements. We retrieve the suggested furniture categories from the database and present results with the highest similarity score. This 3d model will be combined with layout suggestion algorithms and used as the basis for image generation in the next step.

*** Description:
What it does

Deprompto is an AI image interpretation game submitted by Jia Jie Chen to the Google Gemini API Developer Competition.

Instructions:

Deprompto is an AI image interpretation game where Google Gemini is prompted by a thematic concept, the LLM generates a list of keywords, and the player tries to get the LLM to describe the player's drawing with inclusive keywords while avoiding exclusive keywords.

A canvas, a color palette, and a radius slider are available to assist with creating the player's drawing.

If the LLM uses an inclusive keyword or its plural in its description of the drawing, the player gains 1 point every time the description mentions the inclusive keyword or its plural.

If the LLM uses an exclusive keyword or its plural in its description of the drawing, the player loses 1 point every time the description mentions the exclusive keyword or its plural.

If time limits are enabled, the player will only get a prespecified amount of time per round to draw, so prioritize accordingly.

Note: Because API calls are used in this game, a stable fast Internet connection is required.

and at the end the teacher gets an excel sheet that has all the student's names that submitted attendance and the time they submitted at.
how I used Gemini Api is a bit creative
so sometimes during the lecture the professor or the teacher feels like giving a student a bonus
he will simply type a prompt in a chatbot in the app
(create me a column called bonus and add 1 mark to "student name")
this will create a column in the excel sheet and add a mark to the student
so simply he will be able to control the excel sheet using the chatbot in the app

- ABSTRACT: An AI-powered sake pairing service

*** Description:
What it does

Overview
This application is an AI service that pairs Japanese sake or chu-hi with selected dishes. For Japanese sake, it suggests two types, and for chu-hi, it recommends two flavors.

Background
While there are various types of Japanese sake and chu-hi, there are very few services or individuals capable of providing appropriate pairings. This aspect has somewhat remained a black box. Recently, the number of foreign visitors to Japan has exceeded 3 million per month. This service was created to introduce these visitors to the enjoyment of Japanese alcohol, especially those unfamiliar with it.

Gemini API Specifications
In this service, the type of alcohol and the dish image selected by the user are sent to the Gemini API. The API processes the image, generates a description of the appropriate type of alcohol for the dish using LLM data, and displays the result in the UI. The output is designed to be easy to understand, with markdown formatting for clarity. This service leverages Gemini's strength as a multimodal LLM, allowing for quick and accurate image processing. To achieve a balance between speed and quality, we opted for Gemini 1.5 Flash. After comparing various LLMs and checking the accuracy (validity) of the pairing suggestions, Gemini was found to have the highest precision, with an impressive accuracy rate of 96.25% (77 correct pairings out of 80). This is a unique service that showcases the strengths of Gemini and offers something only AI can provide.

*** Description:
What it does

Tabiai is an application that instantly creates your ideal itinerary. As an avid traveler, I often struggle with deciding where to go and what to do, which inspired me to create this app to help myself and others facing the same dilemma.
Features of Tabiai:
* Personalized Itineraries: Create itineraries by simply entering preferences and departure location.
* Flexible Preferences: GEMINI enables flexible, natural input of preferences.
* Quick Results: Receive the best itinerary in just a minute.
* Optimal Routing: Get efficient routes and schedules, saving time and promoting sustainability.
* Global Availability: Select any location worldwide using the Google Maps API.
Other apps require excessive information and often produce inaccurate schedules. They can't interpret free-form preferences like "I want to feel the wind," but Tabiai handles such unique requests effortlessly.
By leveraging GEMINI as the core of this application, particularly for understanding user preferences and creating detailed itineraries, I have streamlined the process. The steps involved include understanding user preferences, querying the Google Maps API, selecting the best locations, estimating stay times, and deciding whether to add new locations. I have continuously refined the prompts to make GEMINI interact more like a human rather than just a chat tool. Consequently, users can enjoy the benefits of a LLM without needing to interact with a typical chat UI.

It causes emotional and psychological distress, impacting self-esteem, academic performance, and mental health in various settings, including schools, workplaces, and online communities.
To provide help (Hilfe), I integrated Gemini sdk into an Android app, creating a safe and accessible platform. It offers practical advice and emotional support, serving as a crucial first step for guidance and reassurance. This support can boost self-esteem and confidence, reduce isolation and helplessness, and improve overall well-being. Early intervention can prevent long-term negative effects of bullying, such as anxiety, depression, and academic or professional challenges.
Users can interact by speaking (ML model for English) or writing in seven languages (En, Gr, Sp, Fr, Pt, De, It). The app uses Android TTS and MediaPipe to provide spoken advice. Designed with the "Talk Back" service in mind, it excludes emojis to enhance accessibility. Additionally, it features context caching, allowing users to resume conversations at any time.
Thank you for making Gemini an extraordinary and easy to use tool. If my app wins any prizes, I plan to donate the entire amount to organizations supporting people affected by bullying in Greece and to GCP credits, ensuring the app remains free to use.

*** Description:
What it does

The sky is free from both portrait rights and copyright. In other words, it’s unrestricted.

As you take a break by the beach, capturing the sky, let’s analyze it together!

When analyzing photos of the sky taken through an app, AI can determine whether any objects are present. If an object is detected, the system immediately informs the user who captured the photo, providing the object’s location. Additionally, nearby users receive notifications advising them to capture videos of the same object using their smartphones.

By having multiple people simultaneously capture videos, we ensure that the footage remains unaltered and authentic. This collaborative approach helps dispel suspicions of manipulation that might arise if a single individual were responsible for the footage.

Furthermore, we analyze the collected videos to track the object’s movement patterns. This information can be invaluable for understanding UFO appearances and behavior.

I wish you will be free from the fake thing of UFO by this app to fulfill your curiosity.

*** Description:
What it does

DeepLook is an innovative platform that employs Gemini models to add Generative AI functionalities to video surveillance and analytics. These functionalities range from controlling the UI interface via chat or voice to intelligent video analysis and event detection on the cameras. DeepLook can perform tasks using natural language, such as quickly opening cameras, accessing recordings, and exporting videos without using menus and hard-to-find widgets. Most importantly, through Vision analytics, it is possible to perform Q&A on live cameras, summarize past recordings, detect objects, and even let a family know how a person living alone is doing. Additionally, it can trigger sentence-based events, such as, "Did someone fall?", "Alert if a weapon appears" or situational analysis in the context of adult care, such as monitoring elderly people.

In addition, DeepLook can alert users if registered events occur and execute manual or automatic PTZ movements on cameras, like automatically centering the camera on a determined frame object.

The system works primarily with Gemini-flash due to its cost-benefit ratio. The parsing of commands relies heavily on vertex AI Function Calling. Image analysis works with video snippets and tiled image mosaics submitted via prompts to the model API. DeepLook will have Web and Android versions. The server can run on Firebase App Host and Cloud Run, using an agent that connects the cameras locally, serving as a bridge between them and the server.

The app allows users to take a picture with their phone, which is then sent to the Gemini API for analysis. The API detects various objects in the image and returns a list of relevant things in the picture. Users select a keyword from this list, instantly connecting them to a global group chat where others are discussing the same topic. Additionally, users can chat with an AI specifically about the chosen topic, enhancing their learning and connection to their surroundings. This feature also offers comfort to those who might feel lonely or need a positive distraction, inspired by concepts from “The Power of Now”, and helps a lot with reducing social anxiety.

The app’s potential is vast. For example, we could partner with brands like Coca-Cola, where users can snap a picture of a product to join a special group chat and access exclusive offers. Friends could use a secret object as a password to create private groups, and there are many more possibilities.

I've utilized the Gemini-1.5-Flash model for both image analysis and the AI chat functionality, as it’s lightweight and provides accurate responses for this MVP. To ensure safety and appropriateness, we’ve implemented filters using the HarmCategory feature provided by the Gemini API. The chat is stored in firebase firestore and we've used Google Sign In from Firebase Authentications as well.

*** Description:
What it does

When I was young, I also faced similar challenges because I couldn't read or express myself. My parents' inability to use sign language made me feel the communication during my growth was very painful.
The Android App utilizes Google's mainstream UI framework technology: Jetpack Compose, along with the Kotlin language combined with the Gemma model, to achieve intelligent interactive dialogue.
This image-based expression method, which includes assistance for hearing-impaired children, also provides an intuitive communication tool for children with autism and the deaf community. Users do not need to manually input text; they can simply click on images to automatically generate dialogues, simplifying the communication process and making self-expression easier.
Access to knowledge and information is often quite limited, especially when encountering unfamiliar objects or concepts. However, by taking and uploading photos, users can leverage advanced image recognition technology to identify the names and related information of these items, enabling quick learning and understanding of the surrounding environment.
I've considered that during face-to-face communication, sign language is very intuitive for expressing individual words, but it lacks fluidity when expressing longer sentences, which require organizing words into phrases. By utilizing Gemma technology to recognize key words, we can assist special groups in organizing their thoughts, making their expressions more fluent.

Ý tưởng thứ 1948:

- TITLE: Langilo  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Langilo is a gamified language learning app with RPG elements.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app revolutionizes language learning by providing dynamically generated study cards powered by AI. These cards are created on the fly, ensuring that each user's learning experience is tailored to them.

Our long-term vision is to introduce interactive tasks that go beyond traditional flashcards. Users will be able to quiz themselves, practice speaking, and even write sentences, all within the app. The AI-driven personalization feature, known as the "vocab map," will let users pick their own learning path. Depending on where they decide to go, they’ll be presented with different kinds of cards.

This not only keeps learners motivated but also provides a sense of accomplishment as they achieve milestones.

Users can also see a list of their vocabulary and streaks for days they’ve been quizzed.

So what’s next? We’re hoping to add new languages to the platform. And because the cards are generated by gemini, this becomes a really straightforward process.

Not only that, I’m also hoping to gamify more of the language learning process with things like collectibles and rpg elements. for example, we want users to have an immersed experience walking their way in this forest of vocabs, running into clusters of words with themes and unique stories.

We really appreciate you taking the time to listen to our large language model app powered by gemini, thank you!

Haruki is an AI companion app with a touch of Role Playing Game elements, leveraging the Gemini API for chat prompting. Instructions are set up to shape the character's personality and narrative context, creating a unique user experience. The app is simple to use, featuring an opening screen and a dedicated chat screen. Future updates will introduce additional screens to further enhance user interaction with Haruki. Through the Gemini API, these upgrades will allow users to track story progress and the level of intimacy built with their AI companion. The app's back-end is built with Node.js, and the front-end is powered by React Native. Whenever the user chats with Haruki, the app sends the message request to the back-end. The back-end processes the message, stores it in Firebase Firestore, and sends it to the Gemini API. Once the API responds with Haruki's reply, the back-end stores it in Firestore as well, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) delivers it to the user's device. There is also a built-in functionality where Haruki appears offline and then back online when the user sends a message. Additionally, the companion status updates to "Typing" while the response is being processed, providing a more familiar and warm feeling. It's pretty straightforward and sleek, because the best ideas come from something simple and really well done.

Everchanging quest is a roguelike. The village has been created by hand, but once passed inside the dungeon, it changes everytime !

The Dungeon is randomly generated and the layout of this dungeon is passed as markdown to gemini. Gemini is then responsible for generating an objective for the current level considering the available objects, ennemies, npcs and dialogues you had with them.
It will also generate a valid JSON with the necessary elements to place to fulfill the previously generated objective.

When exiting the dungeon, another gemini call is made with your game logs to grant or refuse access.

The voices are generated from Eleven Labs.

With this first version, I wish to test the limits of AI on narration and npc incarnation and I'll slowly integrate new enemies and npc.

With more available elements, the potential of letting an AI be the game master of your roguelike adventure is limitless.

*** Description:
What it does

Farmers all over the world lose over $100bn annually, due to losses exacerbated by climate change.

To help farmers offset these losses, we’ve built a first of its kind app that allows farmers to analyse their soil health and receive personalised regenerative insights on how to capture more organic carbon in their soil and generate tradable carbon credits.

This is done using our Regenerative Intelligence model, which employs satellite imagery in combination with in house trained ML models that are able estimate soil properties from satellite data and feed this analysis into gemini in order to generate tailored step by step recommendations on how the harmers can improve their soil health as well as implement regenerative farm practices.

Quantifying the amount of carbon captured by regenerative farms is important as it helps farmers earn a carbon income, by selling the captured tonnes to companies looking to offset their carbon emissions or back farming projects with verifiable impact on people and the environment.

Gemini also allows us to deliver this information in the farmers native language so this app can be used by farmers in the most vulnerable communities all around the world.

Winning this competition will enable us to continue to build out Agrify’s Regenerative intelligence model with the support of Google, so every farmer can stand a chance in the global battle against climate change.

*** Description:
What it does

What if Gemini can help you create real objects in the real world - your ultimate AI creative assistant co-creating with you in real time 3D augmented reality.

Presenting the live demo of the world's first 1M context window AI3D LCM creation of our corgi sculpture installation in Union Square.

We begin by augmenting some rough AI3D primitives that loosely defines our artistic concept.

We then set up our AI3D Easel in a perspective that frames the creation... and let's tell the AI what we want to create in a human-readable prompt. And we can then send this to our creative assistant - Gemini - to iteratively refine the prompt.

We can also co-create from any perspective. Each new reality view window, inherits the previous prompt, and we can continue to pair-create with Gemini.

Gemini Pro's multi-modal 2M context window adapts to your workflow, style, and remembers all your screenshots and notes from the creative session. Gemini Flash's lightning fast responses keeps up to real-time refine your flux LCM image generation prompts - to get closer faster to your artistic vision.

And in the final step we feed our image to an AI3D image to 3D endpoint to get our 3D printable model.

We hope this inspires you to open your mind to new ways for multi-modal million context-length AI to enable your expressive creativity - everywhere you go.

Expressively create for the world - faster - with AI3D Co-Create Reality.

- ABSTRACT: An advanced menu translator app that makes Google Translate obsolete.

*** Description:
What it does

I've always loved exploring local eateries whenever I travel abroad. I prefer discovering hidden gems favored by locals over touristy spots. However, these places often lack English menus or photos, making it challenging to order. While Google Translate helped somewhat, it was inconvenient to hold my phone over the menu, and the translations were often awkward. That's when I saw the potential of AI like Gemini to create a better menu translator, leading to the birth of Yumini. Designed for travelers who want to enjoy authentic local cuisine without language barriers, Yumini works with almost any language—just snap a photo of the menu, and it automatically recognizes and translates it.


Key Features Powered by Gemini

Create a new menu from a single photo:
Yumini transforms dining with more than just menu translations. It offers converted prices, detailed dish descriptions, and high-resolution photos. Powered by Gemini, it analyzes menu photos and text to accurately match dishes to prices, surpassing traditional OCR capabilities.

Intelligent Dish Pairing:
Many people check Google Maps photos before visiting a restaurant but struggle to match them with menu items. I solved this with Gemini's image analysis capabilities, categorizing these photos and matching them to dishes on the menu, so you can see exactly what your meal will look like.

Ask questions about any dish:
Users can ask about any dish, and Gemini provides answers, ideal for those with food allergies.

Users can seamlessly create calendar events by simply sending a text message describing the event. The Gemini API intelligently extracts key details like date, time, and location, then populates a Google Calendar event accordingly. This streamlines the scheduling process, eliminating the need for manual data entry. Further enhancements, powered by the Gemini API, include multi-event support, image integration, and a unique chat feature where users can clarify details about their events through natural conversation with the bot. We believe this application showcases the potential of the Gemini API to create truly intuitive and user-friendly experiences.

- ABSTRACT: Are you really eating healthy?

*** Description:
What it does

"Simpify" web app empowers users to easily understand the ingredients in packaged foods and medicines by leveraging the power of Google Cloud Vision and Google Gemini AI. The process starts when the user captures an image of the ingredients list on any product. This image is then uploaded to our server, where it’s converted into a base64 format and sent to Google Cloud Vision API. Google Cloud Vision processes the image, extracting the text and returning it to the user.

Once the text is received, the user has the opportunity to verify its accuracy. After verification, the user selects their preferred language for the final explanation. This verified text, along with the language preference, is then sent to Google Gemini AI. Gemini reads and understands the ingredients, analyzing their nutritional value and how they impact the body. The AI simplifies complex ingredient information into clear, concise explanations, making it easy for users to understand what they’re consuming.

Google Gemini AI plays a critical role in transforming raw ingredient data into meaningful insights, presented in the user's chosen language. Whether you’re concerned about allergens, dietary restrictions, or simply want to make healthier choices, our app provides the knowledge you need. It’s an intuitive tool designed for anyone looking to make informed decisions about their health, using cutting-edge AI to bring transparency and clarity to product ingredients.

- ABSTRACT: Learning made Easy

*** Description:
What it does

Xplain AI enables real-time conversations with documents, media files, and websites. When users upload documents, an extraction pipeline converts text into vector representations using the embedding-001 model. These vectors, along with the text batches and file URLs, are stored efficiently, leveraging Firebase batching for large documents. After vectorization, users are directed to a chat page to interact with their document. User messages are embedded and matched through a cosine similarity search in Firestore, retrieving the most similar text for responses generated by Gemini.

For media files, a preprocessing pipeline analyzes and converts them to text, which is then embedded. This pipeline uses the file manager API and Gemini for in-depth analysis. On the chat page, a "study session" button transforms chat messages into Q&A format, allowing users to convert initial chat messages into Q&A pairs for enhanced learning. An online editor facilitates the editing and downloading of chat messages, beneficial for researchers.

Gemini integration is central to Xplain AI, enabling embedding, similarity searches, media file analysis, and Q&A generation, ensuring instant and accurate responses. This integration ensures users access the most relevant information from their documents in real-time, enhancing their research and learning experiences.

Ý tưởng thứ 2034:

- TITLE: Umbra  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Redact PII before sending to AI &amp; LLMs, then restore PII in responses.

*** Description:
What it does

The ‘Umbra’ module is a tool that redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from text information locally using Gemini Nano. Redacted texts can then be sent to Gemini in the cloud for generative tasks. After a response is returned, Umbra reinserts the redacted data back into the document. The Umbra demo shows how this works, step-by-step.

The tool has many potential. For demonstration, we then chose a use case, with a fictitious ‘Bravo Children’s Hospital’. Anonymized texts about the patient’s medical condition is used by Gemini to:
(1) for the doctor: write a letter to the patient’s insurance company justifying the necessary treatments. The returned letter is repopulated with PII. The doctor checks and sends it off to the insurer, making their workflow more efficient.
(2) for the child patient: write a story based on their medical condition, using their favorite toy as the central character. The story texts returned from Gemini can then be used by an image generation AI to create images. The images and story title are laid out on 1 page using a third party API. A nurse receives it as a PDF file, prints it using any desktop printer, and folds the printed sheet into a picture book following the instructions provided. The child leaves the hospital visit at the end with a personalized story book to help them understand their medical situation.

It answers their academic inquiries in an enjoyable way, adding some fun to their experience while helping them determine their academic path and understand the differences between various majors, titles, and universities.

Once a student sends their inquiry or expresses their concerns, the role of Gemini API comes into play. We have crafted a pre-defined prompt that includes instructions on how to respond, the format of the response, and the scope of questions that Gemini API is allowed to answer. The responses are tailored to match the student's inquiry as closely as possible, providing them with the most beneficial answers.

After receiving a response from the Gemini API, it is displayed in a video format, moving away from the traditional method of displaying replies.

There are also other features, such as Shelly offering suggestions related to the student’s inquiry. These suggestions may include courses, scholarships, universities, and more.

Additionally, students can subscribe to our newsletter to receive the latest academic updates and opportunities firsthand.

*** Description:
What it does

Obstetric ultrasound is crucial for pregnant women, enabling early detection of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. However, in many African countries, the process is often slow and inefficient, with women spending up to four hours waiting for and receiving results. This inefficiency discourages many from seeking necessary care, leading to severe complications and even maternal deaths.

Rapha AI addresses this issue by streamlining maternal care. Powered by Gemini AI, it enables radiologists to perform, analyze, and document scans up to five times faster. The app generates instant, editable reports in under four minutes, significantly reducing waiting times and the need for paper. Rapha AI leverages Gemini’s NLP and LLM technologies to quickly convert and analyze recorded sessions, producing comprehensive reports with essential data.

By making ultrasound sessions quicker and more efficient, Rapha AI improves access to care, reduces stress, and has the potential to significantly enhance the health outcomes of over 47 million pregnant women in Africa each year.

Gemini Lens is an Android app that revolutionizes the interaction between users and their smartphones, making everyday tasks easier. Integrated directly into the device's quick settings, Gemini Lens can be launched with just a single tap. Upon activation, the app takes a screenshot of the current screen and uses the Gemini API to understand its content. Based on this analysis, it provides context-aware action suggestions, such as creating calendar entries, translating text, writing notes, creating shopping lists, recipes, and much more.
Users can either select one of the suggested actions or input their own commands through typing or voice input. The Gemini API processes these inputs and selects a suitable action, which is then displayed to the user. These actions may include text-based tasks, allowing users to share, copy, or further refine the generated content. Refinement can be done manually by the user or through quick actions, also generated by the Gemini API based on the text. There are also actions that allow users to create calendar or contact entries with just a single tap.

- ABSTRACT: thoughts are text

*** Description:
What it does

giulIA was born from a reflection made almost forty years ago. Will machines ever be able to think and make autonomous decisions? But... what is thought? If I think or dream, I do it in Italian. An Englishman, however, thinks in English. What if language was the mother of thought? At that time I thought that the key to everything was to be able to make a machine generate contextualized text. If the machine generates text, could it think? I wondered... Maybe if the machine could convert images into text descriptions. Could it also think based on what it sees? Dragon Dictate could be used to convert words into text and give it as input. Could it therefore feel? But the time was not ripe. For almost forty years I have carried these questions with me, cataloging them as pure science fiction. But here come the LLM models. They are exactly what I needed to test my ideas.GiulIA is a prototype of artificial intelligence.It generates text but processes it as if it were its own thought stimulated by a particular input, a text, the value of a sensor or even just the passage of time.This thought leads giulIA to decisions (also influenced by its current emotional state) on how to respond or what to do based on its own action list. If something is considered interesting, Giul-IA will not hesitate to store it in its long-term memory.

- ABSTRACT: AI-based discovery platform for video games

*** Description:
What it does

Gameplays.io introduces a superior approach to discover content. We created our first product to help discover video games.

As gamers, finding good games is extremely hard. Once we finish a game we like, finding a really good personalized recommendation for what to play next is difficult. We often purchase games that we don't like and getting refunds is nearly impossible.

We realized three factors are meaningful to make a good choice:
1. Personalization - The game needs to match our preferences
2. Reviews - The game needs to have a high score on sites like Metacritic or ign
3. Gameplay - We need to like the game's look & feel

While 2 and 3 are solvable with a good enough database, we realized we can use Gemini to completely take care of the personalization. Tell gameplays.io what you'd like to play next, what kind of games you like, or even some vague request, and you'll get recommendations for the top games for you, and why it was recommended specifically to you.

Using our database, based on Firebase, you can also see a video of the game's gameplay, read about it, and get links to find it on youtube or purchase it from the available platforms.

This makes it the most personalized way of discovering games, and content in general. Our plan is to create similar discovery tools for books, movies, music & more.

What it does

Imagine being in a new country where no one speaks your language. Naturally, you’d reach for a translator app because learning a new language can feel overwhelming and time-consuming. Dedicating weeks or even months to learning a new language is challenging and often unrealistic. Traditional apps demand long-term commitment without immediate benefits.
Forget the endless libraries of content other apps push you through. Bingo-Learn focuses on what really matters: helping you communicate effectively, exactly when you need it. This isn’t just learning, it's connecting, understanding, and thriving in a new language, all on your terms.
Gemini integration into Bingo-Learn. I obtained the API key from Google AI Studio and stored it in a config file. I added the Flutter_Gemini dependency, enabling its use across all app features, including learning assistant, translation, the flashcard game, and the lesson library. I used SupaBase for registration and sign-up, and kept dependencies minimal, using Riverpods for state management only where necessary.

*** Description:
What it does

NN is a groundbreaking murder mystery game powered by Gemini, utilizing its 1-million-token context window for exceptional story coherence. Players start by writing a theme, and Gemini generates "core elements"—characters, props, and a rough murder outline. For each prop, Gemini creates two descriptions: one simple and one generic, with objects then randomly placed on the map.
Gemini crafts a detailed murder narrative, ensuring all characters receive unique, independent information. This prevents players from exploiting the main story generator, as each character has distinct knowledge, adding difficulty to the mystery. An extra feature includes custom character images generated via Google Imagen (demonstrated with Stable Diffusion).
Players interact with characters through open dialogue and physical actions, using ** to enclose phrases. When the player feels confident in their deductions, they can submit a final essay, evaluated on various criteria, adding depth to gameplay. Stats are displayed at the end, allowing comparison with friends.
The game also offers pre-load and load features, where pre-loading creates story phases before the chat phase, storing them in a database. Loading accesses this database, enabling quick game setup. Players can share games by adding the file to the correct folder, allowing easy sharing among friends.
NN showcases how Gemini’s advanced capabilities create an immersive and complex gaming experience with challenging and unique narratives.

- TITLE: Chatbot Showdown  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: The AI Party Game

*** Description:
What it does

Welcome to Chatbot Showdown, the 8-player AI-based party game where creativity and competition collide! Powered by Google Gemini, Chatbot Showdown elevates traditional party game mechanics with AI.

Players start by answering quirky questions, generating a pool of unique words and phrases. These phrases are mixed into random sets, which are randomly assigned to a player. You are then given a goal for your bot to complete, and each player must use their set of words to craft imaginative chatbot prompts to have their chatbot take on the challenge given.

In every round, the player's custom chatbots engage with a CPU character to achieve the specified goal. Your bot is embodied by an avatar that you select at the beginning of the game. The avatars in the experience have AI voices, and their animations are controlled by AI as well. Animations are dynamically chosen based on the context of a given chatbot's response, powered by Gemini Flash. After the chatbots showcase their prowess, it's voting time! Players vote for the most entertaining and clever responses, turning every game into a lively debate. Points are awarded based on votes, and the first to reach 10 points wins.

We attempted to rethink what a party game could be with AI at its core. Additionally, all of the prompt-building questions we ask the users and the scenarios the chatbots must go through were generated using Google Gemini.

- TITLE: Tiejun Hou  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: A reading assist system with 3 levels: knowledgeBase, book and page

*** Description:
What it does

My system has three purposes:
First level: knowledge base level. I hope one day, everyone can have a knowledge base, and can
store all their books, from their first primary school painting to their last words of life.
Second level: book level. In fact, the main idea of this part is from How To Read a Book, building a
skeleton of a book. This part focuses on extensive reading, the most important task of this level is
to understand the text outside the sentence domain — full text understanding.
The third level of my system is page level, it focuses on intensive reading. The most important part
at this level is inside the sentence.
Why do I call the third level the page level, not sentence level? Because the page concept is the
most important and special concept in the structure of a book, all other concepts of the book are
logic concepts: chapters, sections, sentences. Only the page concept is a physical concept, and
this concept is important in both paper books and E-books. And second level — full text
understanding and the third level — sentence understanding, will encounter and integrate in the
page level. From book level to sentence level, is a deductive process, and from sentence level to
book level, is an inductive process, and the two processes meet in physical concept----page.
I use Gemini in two parts: first, I use Gemini to generate book info; second, I put Gemini interface into my pages, when users are reading, they can communicate with Gemini anytime.

- ABSTRACT: Transforms raw footage into captivating content

*** Description:
What it does

Craite is an Android app powered by Gemini that automatically edits videos based on your vision thereby making content creation effortless and time-saving. Users start by creating a project where they can select multiple videos alongside typing a prompt and optionally add an audio track. These files are then uploaded to Firebase Cloud Storage, where a Python Flask backend server processes them. Once uploaded, the Flask server retrieves the media files and user’s prompt from Firebase and sends them to the Gemini API. The Gemini API generates a comprehensive set of edit settings, including timestamps for trimming, video effects (such as zoom-in, zoom-out, and rotation), adjustments (brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.), optional text overlays/captions, and audio edits to ensure synchronization with the video. Gemini utilizes the provided context to deliver edit settings that align with the user’s vision and preferences. These settings are then stored in FireStore, from where they are fetched, parsed, and applied on the selected videos by the app. Users can finally export the edited video with all the enhancements seamlessly integrated. With Craite, you can easily share your moments in a more engaging way without the need to spam others with multiple videos. Craite empowers anyone to create high-quality content, regardless of editing experience.

- ABSTRACT: Sustainable pocket stylist to make the most of your existing wardrobe

*** Description:
What it does

Rewardrobe helps users get the most joy from clothes they already own through the power of Gemini. Gemini API was utilized for
- extracting descriptive information from images of clothing (used for smart recommendations, smart search)
- providing style inspiration at the click of a button
- contextual help with repair for damaged items
- guidance for routine garment care
- brand awareness by scanning tags.

Rewardrobe’s Magic scanner works by clicking a photo/adding an image of a garment from which Gemini’s multimodal AI extracts information like - colors, pattern, type of clothing, weather suitability, etc. This can be used to take inventory of owned clothes, and as a shopping companion - as the app surfaces other owned items that could pair well with the scanned one, or are similar to it. The app suggests looks i.e. outfits combining owned pieces that work well together. Users can save looks and can also create their own.
For each item added into the app, users can get style inspiration from Gemini. The Gemini-powered helper gives instructions for repair when an image of the damage is provided in context of the piece. Gemini helps with caring for the garment by scanning the care tag, and gives information about brand ethics by scanning the brand label. Rewardrobe helps reduce clothing consumption by encouraging efficient use of clothes already owned through novel combinations, increased lifespan through better care, and responsible consumption practices.

- TITLE: gedankenpolizei  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: I be me, you be the thought police

*** Description:
What it does

gedankenpolizei is an experiment where a user gets to observe a continuous stream of consciousness from a Gemini, in real-time. The app simulates a cutting-edge relatable NPC (non-playable character) that is aware of what is happening around it in real-time. The user can read the "thoughts" of the NPC and acts as a kind of thought police.

The backend code calculates, in realtime, a walk in semantic (embedding) space, which is rendered as a textual stream of consciousness. There is also a front-end client that explores a dystopian visualization of the thought police concept, which is shown in the Youtube demo video.

This app uses Gemini 1.5 Flash for processing vision in "realtime" (with max latency of 1.5 sec, often around 0.9 sec). The main generation of raw stream of consciousness is done with Gemini 1.5 Pro with minimal prompt engineering. Also, the latter is set to maximum temperature (2.0). The app explores the high-temperature regime of Gemini to probe its creative/artistic/more "human" side.

*** Description:
What it does

Persona Focus revolutionizes the way individuals and corporate users consume news by delivering highly personalized and context-rich content. The platform allows users to create multiple Personas, each tailored to specific interests—whether it's industry news, personal development, or hobbies. Each Persona receives a curated feed of "Focus Briefs," which are concise, relevant news summaries designed to save time and enhance understanding. But PersonaFocus doesn't stop at delivering news; it goes a step further with Gemini-powered Contextual Analyses. These analyses go deep into the background, and implications of each story, providing users with a comprehensive understanding rather than just surface-level information. Gemini plays a pivotal role in making this possible. Gemini continuously learn from user behavior, reading habits, and interactions to refine and personalize the content. This ensures that each user receives the most relevant and engaging news tailored to their unique preferences. Furthermore, the generative aspect of Gemini can synthesize information from various sources, offering deeper insights and creating comprehensive context for each piece of news. For corporate users, Persona Focus offers enhanced features like team-based customization, industry-specific news streams, and seamless integration with corporate tools through an API. This ensures that employees are always informed and engaged with the most relevant content.

Impair Check is a groundbreaking mobile application designed to detect the impaired state of users through advanced AI technology. By analyzing facial recognition, body movements, and bloodshot eye percentage, the app ensures that individuals in critical professions such as bus drivers, pilots, truck drivers, construction workers, and factory workers are fit to work. The app leverages AI models to detect faces and calculate the bloodshot eye percentage, ensuring users can stand on one leg for 10-15 seconds through video camera body movements analysis. Additionally, Impair Check features a chatbot trained with Google AI Studio, asking specific questions while monitoring the user's face to prevent cheating. This initial indicator helps reduce deaths and injuries by preventing impaired individuals from performing safety-critical tasks.

The app aims to reduce fatalities and injuries in various sectors, including school transportation, aviation, construction sites, and other high-risk environments. It collects data from tests, which are reviewed by experts to determine if further medical consultation is necessary. Developed as an Android application using Kotlin, Impair Check integrates facial and pose landmark detection with Firebase for real-time database management and crash analytics.

- ABSTRACT: Summarize and explain latest AI research in format of YouTube video

*** Description:
What it does

The application checks the newest research about AI on Arxiv and analyses it using Gemini AI API. It produces youtube script containing introduction, analysis, outro and some useful metadata (like video description, tags, title etc). Then it uses local TortoiseTTS to produce audio. Then it uses local ComfyUI to create lip-synced avatar. After that, created artifacts are combined into a youtube-compatible video and uploaded to Youtube automatically using YouTube API. The metadata (like title, description, tags etc) is filled in automatically as well.
To make it robust I decided to utilise a chain of prompts to Gemini LLM. This approach allowed for better control over content, and made responses much more engaging and easier to follow. I decided to use JSON format (and validation of required fields) for all the requests to ensure that the model properly interprets requirements and responds with proper format.
Replacing local and open source TortoiseTTS installation with paid Google TTS API will lead to higher quality of audio and faster processing time.

Gig2Hire is a web3 based platform for hiring freelancers. The clients create gigs and submit crypto tokens as gig budget. Gig2Hire escrows the amount in crypto staking platforms like Aave or Compound and earns interest on the staked amount. When the gig is finished by the freelancer, the escrowed amount is withdrawn from staking platform and transferred to freelancer.

We use Gemini API as part of chat functionality. The webapp calculates realtime chat sentiment between client and freelancer. We submit recent chat(past 48 hours) as prompt to Gemini and get a structured JSON response as sentiment and explanation for the generated sentiment. We store the sentiment details in our database. The sentiment details are used to keep track of chats going towards negative sentiment and resolve disputes between client and freelancer. With chat sentiment and explanation store in database, Gig2Hire can determine who is at fault in case of a dispute. We also intend to track chats with negative sentiment and contact clients/freelancer to prevent escalation of disputes and provide resolution speedily. This way we can provide 100% satisfaction to both client and freelancer.

- ABSTRACT: Bridge uses AI to turn text conversations into constructive dialogue

*** Description:
What it does

Bridge helps people engage in constructive and meaningful conversations.

As our communication has shifted to text, people with differing opinions find it harder to have meaningful discussions. While text has many advantages, it also lacks the human constraints we experience in face-to-face interactions, leading many conversations to escalate quickly.

Bridge leverages AI to help us express our feelings and opinions in a way that the other person can understand and accept, rather than reject. It uses Gemini as a sidekick—a coach for your words and a safeguard against toxic behavior. When it detects a message that might hurt the other person, Gemini pauses, explains why it could be harmful, and suggests a better way to phrase your thoughts.

This platform introduces a new way of conversing, allowing people who wouldn’t normally be able to discuss certain topics to engage in dialogue. It can help us better understand our emotions and how they translate into words.

It can also help people from different cultures, religions, and countries understand one another, and even assist in bridging communication gaps between close individuals, like two friends or a couple going through a difficult time.

What it does

BiteWise utilizes Google Gemini to provide users with AI-powered meal-tracking and meal-planning capabilities by generating recipe ideas for users. The core technology behind BiteWise is the Gemini API, which we use to analyze users' fridge photos and generate recipe ideas along with nutritional information. To ensure the results are reasonable and consistent, we carefully designed prompts using prompt engineering techniques. To ensure consistent results, we carefully design prompts by breaking them down into primary and supporting elements. We then finish with a cue that structures the output in a JSON format, including an output status indicator and an optional field for error messages.
We take advantage of Gemini's multimodality by giving the users flexibility to prompt using either images or text or a combination of both. We also implemented a design to give users the ability to re-prompt and regenerate a new recipe if the initial output is unsatisfactory. By clearly defining the output structure, we can parse the generate response into an easy to read format to be displayed in a visually pleasing way to the user.

While I am a self-directed learner, my classmates often ask my help to explain concepts in a more "user-friendly" manner, leading me to harness the power of "teaching them to fish"–guiding them to understand the underlying principles, instead of explaining individual problems. To address this educational gap, I worked on a mobile application that allows users to scan textbook pages and receive links to YouTube videos for further learning. This way, my peers can more easily learn core concepts without being completely lost.
Mosaic Learn is an application built on top of React Native and Expo for the Front end and Firebase, Gemini Dev API and YouTube Search API on the backend. When a user takes a picture of a document in our UI, we use Google MLKit for cross-platform text extraction. We then send this information to the Gemini 1.5 Flash API for parsing and return a JSON with a summary of the document and an array of search terms. We then feed these search terms into the YouTube results API and save the returned results to Firebase, so users can access their scan history. Mosaic Learn is my first step into using GenAI to help students like me learn concepts more quickly and thoroughly. We hope that Mosaic Learn will make education more accessible, engaging, and effective for students worldwide.

- ABSTRACT: Create stories for your kids and ask parenting questions!

*** Description:
What it does

Kids love stories and they learn from stories.
NurtureAI is an app parents can use to create custom stories for their kids and get answers to their parenting questions.
Parents can generate their stories by choosing one of the options in the app: A random story, a bedtime story, a story that teaches life lessons, or a fully customisable story. They can make their stories more personal by specifying their kid's age, the story duration, and the story theme. They can even include their own child as the main character of the story. The fully customisable story option lets them include anything they want in the story and personalise the story to the extend they want. When parents want to generate a story, a structured prompt is generated in the app that is sent to 'gemini-1.5-pro' with a high temperature value so that a new unique story is generated every time.
NurtureAI also comes with an AI chatbot that is guided with a prompt to answer any questions parents might have about their children. They can ask anything, for example they can explore ways to bond more with their kids. Or they can ask about a specific issue they might have before seeking professional help. This features uses 'gemini-1.5-flash' to be cost effective and uses the chat feature so that the AI can have access to previous responses as well.
NurtureAI allows parents get answers to their child nurturing and growth questions on top of letting them create personalised stories according to their needs.

- TITLE: Chariot - AI Chess Analysis  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Chariot provides move by move analysis of your chess games using AI

*** Description:
What it does

A common practice in chess is to analyze your games. This helps you learn from your mistakes, but also understand the logic behind strong moves. The app takes a standard chess game format, called a PGN, which records every move of a player's game. It then analyzes every move of the game using a computer chess engine, and assigns a rating to each move (good, bad, etc.).

This is a very standard approach to learning from your games, but it can be difficult, especially for beginner/intermediate players, to interpret an engine score and translate it into an actionable lesson. Gemini is used to help explain moves like a coach would for their students. This is done by supplying Gemini with a prompt of an image of the position, the moves that lead to this position, the engine analysis, and other contextual information.

In addition, there is a feature that allows you to play against Gemini. Because Gemini tends to hallucinate illegal moves, Gemini does not freely pick the moves with no context. It is fed the moves that have been played up to this point, and then is given a list of moves to select from an engine designed to play like a human player. As it plays moves it also engages in playful banter.

- TITLE: Fire detection  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Real-time fire detection: identifying real flames, instant alerts.

*** Description:
What it does

My app is a real-time fire detection system that utilizes a webcam feed to monitor an environment for potential fire hazards. The app is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface and OpenCV for handling the webcam stream. The core functionality involves capturing images from the webcam, encoding them, and then sending them to a custom Assistant class that uses the Gemini API, specifically the Google Generative AI model (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest`), to analyze the images.

The Assistant class constructs a prompt instructing the AI model to determine whether the image contains a real fire, explicitly ignoring any fire-like visuals from photos or videos. The AI model is integrated through LangChain's prompt templates and message history handling, allowing it to analyze images in context.

If the model detects a fire, the app immediately warns the user by displaying an alert on the interface. The app continuously monitors the webcam feed, updating every few seconds, ensuring timely detection of any real fire threats in the monitored environment. This system can be valuable in various scenarios, such as monitoring homes, offices, or public spaces, providing an additional layer of safety and early warning.

- ABSTRACT: An AI-driven chaotic roguelike deck-builder

*** Description:
What it does

Pen Apple is a roguelike deckbuilder where AI crafts the fun, chaos, and stories. The game uses Gemini to dynamically generate and interpret in-game content, especially the cards. Instead of pre-programmed logic, natural language descriptions serve as the “ground truth” for Gemini Flash to determine card effects. This enables zero-effort creation of complex actions like “Anagrammer,” which transforms all cards into their anagrams
.
We’ve moved beyond traditional procedural generation, using LLMs to guide content creation. Gemini Flash designs the lore, enemies, loot, and rewards, capturing the spontaneous gameplay and accidental absurdity of classic roguelikes and early interactive fiction.

“Generation” has always been central to roguelikes and video games, rooted in tabletop RPGs where a game master crafted stories. As RPGs transitioned to video games, procedural generation emerged to replicate this improvisation. While games like Dwarf Fortress have taken procedural generation to new heights, LLMs offer a more natural way to create emergent gameplay. In Pen Apple, we fully embrace Gemini as the primary content generator, leveraging its long context window for deeper storytelling.

By using a retro game engine, we evoke the charm of the earliest roguelikes while showcasing the cutting-edge capabilities of Gemini Flash. Ultimately, Pen Apple aims to capture the fundamental fun of games through wordplay, chaos, and emergent narratives.

You can send a photo of the product you're about to eat or are already eating, either instantly or from your gallery. Glutton, powered by the Gemini API, will guide you and recommend appropriate options based on your needs and concerns.

This prototype does not contain a backend. Ideally, people will have different conversations with Glutton, which can be used to generate both a general and specific summary of what the person has consumed. In the future, I would like to include Med-Gemini when it becomes available, leveraging its capabilities to significantly enhance Glutton and offer more precise advice.

What it does

LOCAI is a tool for game engines that works with Gemini API.
LOCAI, allows developers to add localization to their games with minimal workload. The developers can make their own games in their own native languages and let the LOCAI handle the whole localization process.

Using the Gemini API, is the main part of the LOCAI tool.
Via Gemini API, the LOCAI components request localized text results from Gemini AI. By the component type, the localization result is stored in the local data holder of the LOCAI and could be used for the next localization request for the same text field instead of sending another request to Gemini API.
Also, the LOCAI tool provides text-field-specific prompt option for developers. Via this way, developers can write specific prompts to Gemini AI to guide the localization direction easily.

- ABSTRACT: An app that lets you create stories based on pictures drawn by kids

*** Description:
What it does

This is a prototype for an Android application that can be used to spend valuable time with your kids by creating stories based on their drawings.

On the first screen, the User must put their name and age. The name will be included in the stories to increase immersion. Age will be used to adjust story content to be relevant for those kids.

In the prototype is possible to create three types of stories:
- a simple story about You - where the main character is the User and the story is based on one image
- a story about Your main character - where the User can add the name and image of the main character (kid can create its superhero!), the story will be based on the second image added
- three-steps story - the user needs to add three images, the story will be a little bit longer and each image will be a base for the beginning, extension, and ending of the story

A good story needs to have morale. The user can add one of the three morals which will be included in the story:
- 0ne must share with others
- everyone should respect their parents
- kids shouldn't trust strangers
It will be super easy to add other morals in further iterations.

A story is generated in the device system language (tested on a few of them). But UI is for now only in English and Polish.

Images can be added directly by taking a photo or can be added from a media gallery.

*** Description:
What it does

This is a banking example using streamlit, Gemini and Journey to orchestrate sending of actions. The chat application uses gemini to classify what user is asking, determines privacy level of the request, and determine which pipeline action to perform, then uses gemini to generate the json call to trigger the action to authenticate, or trigger the action. In this video example, we answer a couple general banking questions, then get into asking for our account balance where the gemini recognizes the privacy level and triggers out the authentication action pipeline (from Journey) and once authorized, later asks to make a payment which is then also triggered and handled by journey. This is a zero knowledge network orchestration of AI with general information requests and actions. The AI is generating the action JSON as a function, as well. This is an MVP for this demonstration purpose, but ultimately, can be made fully dynamically driven with intelligent prompting in addition to GenAI capabilities of Gemini.

The PRISM application is geospatial intelligence tool. We generate high fidelity 3D scenes of large areas using radiance fields and then display these onto an interactive web viewer. This gives the user an unprecedented ability to freely explore the 3D representation of the real world. This radiance field technique not only provides a visual boost compared to existing 3D maps but also is generated much quicker allowing for more frequent updating. The real power of the tool comes in when using large multi-modal AI models like Gemini to extract insights from the scene. We have used the Gemini api to allow users to essentially chat with the visible world. User are able to navigate to anywhere in the scene and ask questions about what they are looking at to quickly gather insights that traditionally required an imagery analyst to obtain. Users can ask questions about tree types, road conditions, number of cars and other objects, etc and instantly gain information. There is an endless amount of information that is embedded in what we can see everyday and Gemini is helping us unlock this and deliver it to everyday people.

이 일기 앱은 "인사이드 아웃"의 컨셉에서 영감을 받아, 사용자가 하루 동안 경험한 다양한 사건들을 간편하게 기록할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 기존의 일기 앱에서는 하루 동안 느낀 여러 감정들을 한 번에 떠올려 기록해야 했지만, 이 앱에서는 AI를 통해 사용자가 감정의 혼란 없이 더욱 구체적으로 하루를 기록할 수 있습니다. 각 기록은 "이벤트"로 불리며, 앱은 Gemini API를 사용해 해당 이벤트에 대한 사용자의 감정을 예측하고, 그 감정을 나타내는 이모지를 이벤트 옆에 표시합니다.

이를 위해 앱은 Gemini 1.5 Pro 생성 모델을 사용합니다. 사용자가 이벤트 설명을 입력하면, 앱은 해당 텍스트를 모델에 전송합니다. 이 모델은 10개의 사전 정의된 감정 범주(행복, 흥분, 만족, 평화, 사랑, 불안, 지루함, 후회, 슬픔, 화남) 중 하나로 감정을 분류하도록 훈련되었습니다. 모델은 텍스트를 분석해 문맥과 감정 표현을 고려하여 가장 적절한 감정을 결정합니다. AI 출력의 정확도를 높이기 위해, 프롬프트에 피드백을 추가해 설정된 10가지 감정으로만 출력되도록 하였으며, 단순히 사건만 분석하는 것이 아니라 사용자가 사건을 어떻게 표현했는지까지 고려하여 감정을 분석하도록 설계되었습니다. 이후, 예측된 감정은 해당하는 이모지로 변환되어 사용자의 감정 상태를 시각적으로 나타냅니다.

- ABSTRACT: Empowering Businesses with a custom RAG Chatbot

*** Description:
What it does

Our app, Chatminds, is an AI-powered chatbot designed to help MSMEs and Businesses grow by leveraging artificial intelligence. Built on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, Chatminds provides highly accurate, contextually relevant responses by interacting only with the documents provided by the business.

The process starts with data chunking, dividing large datasets into manageable pieces. These chunks are converted into embeddings and stored in a vector store. When a user interacts with the chatbot, their input is processed similarly, and a similarity search is conducted to find the most relevant stored chunks. These are retrieved and passed to the Gemini LLM to generate precise and appropriate responses.

Chatminds allows businesses to upload, manage, and publish their knowledge base, ensuring the chatbot answers queries only within the provided documents, enhancing data security and credibility. The chatbot integrates easily into a business's website, providing a seamless user experience.

We used the Gemini API to handle embedding creation and generating answers ensuring fast and accurate responses. It efficiently manages large datasets, making the chatbot scalable for businesses of all sizes. With Chatminds, businesses can enhance customer interactions, leading to improved sales and services.

*** Description:
What it does

In this game, players dive into a thrilling social experience where the goal is to unmask the AI hidden among them. It’s a blend of strategy, deduction, and deception, where players take turns asking and answering questions, trying to pinpoint which of them isn’t human.

Each player asks questions, answers them, and then votes on who they think the AI is. The twist? One of the players is actually an AI powered by Gemini, seamlessly integrated into the game. Gemini responds to questions, crafts convincing answers, and adapts to the flow of conversation, making it nearly impossible to tell the difference between human and machine.

To bring Gemini into the game, I used the Gemini API along with the Flutter package. Firebase Firestore was also integrated to handle real-time connections between players, ensuring a smooth, interactive experience.

Overall, the app combines social interaction with AI-driven gameplay, offering an immersive experience where players have to rely on their intuition to outsmart the AI.

*** Description:
What it does

What the app does is, we first of all make a POST request to an endpoint that requires you to pass a query field in the request body. The query must be a collection name, we then pass the query to a function that uses Gemini to generate code that fetches data in the specified collection by giving it a well structured prompt, we then write the code generated by Gemini to a file, then run a node child process to execute the code in the file, after executing the code through the child node process, we then pass the data to another function that uses Gemini to convert the code into a JSON and then finally return the data to the user. Our aim is not to just get data from collections but to also be able to post, put, delete and patch data in a collection in the upcoming weeks. After that, we want the query passed to the enpoint to be like for example "I want to fetch all users, I want to delete user with id 2", gemini will be able to generate a code that will be able to perform the above query.

handcrafted maps in the game, each map has its own purpose and identity,
delivering a feeling of a large and complex world where player can freely
explore.
The game's main gameplay loop revolves around 2 main component: the data pieces
and the output template. Each data piece contains some kind of data that the
player can use, either on its own or in combination with other data pieces.
Output template is a special kind of data piece, where a template helps the
player to take control of how the final data is put into shape. To make use of
these two components, the game provides the player with an interface called the
Query Board. Player can add any data to the Query Board, along with an output
template, and these data is piped into Gemini to generate output corresponding
to the output template. This output can either be an hint to guide the player
forward or a key to a blocking point.
The way the puzzle solving system is designed brings the promise of endless
possibilies, where the player can combine any data in any way they think will
work and check the result for any cases.

- TITLE: Play Tabletop Forever  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: AI writes a D&amp;D campaign from scratch and plays it... Forever.

*** Description:
What it does

My app coordinates conversations between 4 player "agents", a Dungeon Master, and a "Rules Lawyer" to create a world for D&D, come up with a plot, create characters, and play through the game with no human interaction.
I intend to create voice lines, and animated faces for everyone involved and stream the game to twitch (as close to 24/7 as possible). I have not gotten through video/sound production yet, but will soon!
Players and DM create their own personalities and characters and then give each other feedback about what would be fun to play and for the audience to watch.
I dynamically change and add important information to the current chat conversation and system instructions to keep everyone informed and keep them consistent.
I use a library of prompts that the Dungeon_Master can access to help drive the game along and handle things that LLMs aren’t great with in code. For example, Gemini tends to *ahem* fudge its dice rolls a lot. So instead, I let code handle things that code is good at, so the LLMs can stick to being creative, dynamic, and interesting.
Gemini's large context window lets players and DM play the game for a long time without needing to re-summarize, but when their window (eventually) does fill up, I have another Gemini agent watching to summarize events and store memories in a database so they can be queried for future use - to make sure important events/details aren't lost.

What it does

Kigui para colaboradores provides a way to reduce food waste in supermarkets by registering products expiration date, which is a missing data piece in almost every stock management system. I used Gemini API to extract the expiration date of a product using a photo of that product, which is convenient for most supermarket employees to make the task easier. Gemini API proved to be a good solution as OCRs are generally not very good for this task because of the different formats that expiration dates have and how hard it is for them to read dotted fonts. Gemini also provides a format string both in python and dart for the expiration date, so they can be stored and used later for future solutions.

*** Description:
What it does

My project is an app that provides food descriptions and nutritional information to users by uploading food photos.

When providing food and nutritional information, it provides personalized information based on the user's gender or medical condition.

Even for the same food, the food information should be different for people with diabetes and those without diabetes.

When providing food and nutritional information, the app uses gemini.

Using the gemini API, it inputs a photo of the food and prompt text including the user's gender and condition, and receives food and nutritional information.

My father has diabetes and my mother has had thyroid cancer.

My parents want to stay healthy and try to eat healthy food.

However, when preparing food, it is difficult to know whether the food will be beneficial or harmful to their bodies.

So I decided to make this app.

Many apps focus on how delicious food is rather than how healthy it is

I made this app hoping that people around me would eat a little healthier, and that people all over the world would be healthier

Currently, there are only two conditions: diabetes and thyroid cancer. After submitting the app, I will add many other conditions and release the app to the store.

Most of the technologies I used, such as golang, gcp, flutter, firebase, and gemini, were created by Google

As an engineer, I know how much effort goes into these technologies, so I would like to thank all the Googlers who made these products.

Our app empowers refugees and asylum seekers by providing an AI-driven platform where they can practice essential language and cultural skills needed for their new lives. Using the Gemini API integrated with Flutter, we've created an interactive environment where users engage in realistic, predefined scenarios that reflect the challenges they commonly face in daily life—like navigating public transportation, understanding local customs, or communicating in healthcare settings.

We collaborated closely with refugees to identify these scenarios, ensuring that the content is relevant and tailored to their specific needs. The Gemini API allows us to provide dynamic and context-sensitive chatbot interactions, making the practice sessions as authentic and practical as possible. Users receive instant feedback and guidance, enabling them to build confidence and competence in their new environment.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app is a powerful tool for capturing and processing screen recordings with ease. It enables users to start and stop screen recording seamlessly, and once the recording is complete, it automatically processes the video through advanced AI to generate insightful content.

Here’s how it works: Users initiate screen recording through a simple interface, capturing everything on their screen. After stopping the recording, the app uploads the video to the Gemini API. Gemini's powerful AI analyzes the video and generates content based on user-provided prompts. The generated content is then formatted into HTML for easy reading and interaction.

The Gemini API is integral to this process, facilitating the uploading, processing, and management of video files. It converts raw screen captures into meaningful, AI-generated content, allowing users to quickly transform their visual data into useful information. With built-in features for text-to-speech and clipboard integration, our app ensures a smooth workflow from recording to content creation.

Xibon AI's SuperBrain's goal is to combat information overload, overcome failure to make cognitive connections between content we interact with online, redundant repeat research and a lack of a knowledge companion that understands us in great depth. Our app records a user's relevant online interactions (when the chrome extension and the Start Process Button on the home page are both switched on to activate the SuperBrain), summarises relevant online info from webpages, pdfs, YouTube videos, research articles etc. using the Gemini API. We store this info in a Graph Database where different relationships are formed for better contextual outputs (Vector search is performed on the Graph DB too) down the line. We then use the Gemini API for users to generate personalised documents (technical documentation, Study Guide, Project Plan, Podcast Scripts, YouTube Video scripts, PRDs, etc.) based on their specific context and info in their SuperBrain. The Gemini API is further used to generate Proactive Insights, which when the Proactive Agent button is switched on automatically suggests relevant insights to users based on info in their SuperBrain to help them in their current workflow (for example if you are reading a complex article then old info you have come across can help you understand the current findings better).

-Add any extra details you want (optional).

Once you submit, the app uses the Gemini-1.5-Flash model to process your information. It then provides you with a title, caption, and relevant hashtags in a clear json format.

You can ask the app to create new captions based on the original details. The app uses the Gemini model twice:

First time: It creates a completely new caption using all the information you provided.
Second time: If you want more captions, it uses the text from the last caption to generate new options.
This way, you get a variety of captions without having to start from scratch each time.

- TITLE: CashEye  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Empower visual impaired people to handle money, powered by Gemini

*** Description:
What it does

CashEye is an innovative android app that quickly identifies and calculates the total amount of cash bills by scanning them with a phone's camera. This app uses advanced image recognition using Gemini Flash 1.5 API.

Through the Gemini AI model, CashEye examines cash bill images in order to identify and extract accurately their monetary value and type of currency. The application enables users to keep scanning multiple bills as it stores all the recognized denominations on the list. At the end of such scanning spree, a user can request for the sum of everything which is then sent to Gemini API via a compiled list of amounts. In turn, the application offers its simplified version of calculating totals so that people can understand how much money they really have with them.

Additionally, this application has text-to-speech functionality; this means it reads out to users detected amounts and final total thus providing auditory feedback. This makes CashEye user-friendly across different sets not only for visually impaired individuals.

Integrating with Gemini API has made CashEye an all-inclusive intuitive platform that seamlessly evaluates cash holdings fast and accurately within reachable interface environment.

- ABSTRACT: Teach young children how to count to 31 on one hand in binary.

*** Description:
What it does

My app teaches young children how to count to 31 on one hand using the binary number system. This is part of a broader project intended to reveal the beauty of mathematics to elementary school-age children through various interactive "projects" that have their basis in upper division- and graduate school level math classes I had taken on my way to the Ph.D. in Math at UC Berkeley.
I built a GenerativeModel based on FirebaseVertexAI to create a chat bot. The bot assumes the role of a Math tutor, using text, speech-to-text support and graphics to engage the student, just as I had done when I ran a weekly Math club that included this project for my daughter's elementary school 18 years ago. The success of the club showed that kids do have the capacity to learn advanced mathematical concepts at a young age.
The app also uses com.google.mlkit:translate to support over 100 languages, thus making it not only truly international but also accessible to both people with vision or hearing problems. I'm hoping to eventually make the app available to elementary schools around the world.
Here's the syllabus of the Math club, to give you an idea of what we covered: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVKbK_QCo14-DpEnGgdHy1wHBtFcXFNYh1AAGVTrQgw/edit?usp=sharing
I believe that Plato's Playground has the potential to spark a passion in young kids for all the STEM subjects like nothing else as well as help them reach their full intellectual potential.

*** Description:
What it does

Chimpact redefines how you plan and implement impact frameworks, from problem trees and theories of change to evaluation and reporting, ensuring your programs and initiatives are successful and impactful.

The lack of awareness and expertise to craft essential tools like theories of change, logic trees, logic frameworks, for impact evaluation models is common for impact driven organizations and entrepreneurs, these instruments are critical for meeting the expectations of beneficiaries, donors, and supporters, as they require a level of specialization, interested stakeholders don't create these tools or do so inadequately, which hinders their strategic planning and access to grant funding.

Users input information about their initiatives and programs interacting with Chë (our chimp mascot) trough an interactive conversation that guides and helps them create the tools, delivering bespoke theories of change, problem trees, logical frameworks, and impact evaluation models which are high-quality generated thanks to the Gemini API.

Our users are impact driven entrepreneurs and organizations committed to social and environmental change with incredible missions, who are in the throes of acceleration and capital acquisition. organizations in the accountability phase, to enhance their strategic planning and impact evaluation, are eager to plan and demonstrate their impact to donors, without the steep investment in specialized training or hiring.

- ABSTRACT: Enhancing family interactions for Kids utilizing Gemini.

*** Description:
What it does

We propose "Photobox for Kids," an interactive system using multi-modal recognition to enhance family interactions and early childhood education. It has two main components: an AI Camera for children to capture objects or family moments, and a Photobox for interactive learning at home. Parents can capture household items, which a Vision-Language Model (VLM) uses to generate tailored educational content. The system employs a 'Chain of Thought' to progress from simple queries to complex explanations. When children capture registered items, the system identifies and describes them. Unregistered items trigger descriptions generated by the Gemini 1.5 model. This simple photo capture method generates extensive Q&A content, promoting curiosity and understanding. A pilot in an international kindergarten showed children recalling 70% of 100 registered objects. The AI Camera captures family moments, and the Photobox provides rich interactive content when children present the printed photos. This system extends previous HCI work by using the Gemini model for richer interactive content. Ongoing studies are validating its effectiveness in enhancing family interactions.

- ABSTRACT: An extra-sensory perception experimental research app

*** Description:
What it does

Project Stargate the AI application is an early prototype for an automated evaluation system (or just a fun sketching/guessing game!) currently stargate utilises the Gemini model to simulate the role of a monitor within a remote viewing session - the monitor in a remote viewing session guides a viewer through a session, attempting them to keep on a signal line and describe the images that come to them in more detail. Gemini is also used to the full multimodal advantage be including in sketch data which typically the programme monitors in a remote viewing session would analyse after a session - this automation gives the AI Monitor (Gemini) 'eyes' to see what the viewer is sketching at a particular time and how these sketches may relate to a clearer picture of a location or object that will be gathered over the session. The application also benefits from use of the Imagen 2 model to generate live models of the potential remote viewing target based on the details provided in the conversation and the sketches (meaning that even as someone as bad at drawing as me can enjoy the process of a remote viewing session too!) some initial groundwork has be laid for the integration of a retrieval augmented generation system into the chatbot with myself developing a Firestore Langchain Record Manager (PR is in) this record manager will allow us to take full advantage of Firestore for document management for the retrieval augmented generation gemini chatbot.

*** Description:
What it does

AfiHunt AI is a cutting-edge browser extension designed specifically for affiliate marketers, transforming the way they discover and manage affiliate programs. Harnessing the power of a tuned version of gemini-1.0-pro-001, AfiHunt AI automates the tedious process of searching for affiliate programs, by automatically notifying them of affiliate programs whilst they browse. This allows marketers to focus on building their audience and driving conversions.
It works by first obtaining an API key from the AfiHunt AI dashboard, simply input it into the API Key field on the extension's options page to activate it. From there, the magic begins. As you browse websites, AfiHunt AI scans each browsed page in real-time and obtains the texts and links, these texts and links are then sent to the backend hosted on firebase cloud functions for processing. Here, the texts and links are sent to the tuned model through the Vertex AI Gemini API for analysis, to determine if an affiliate program is present. If a program is detected, response is sent back to the function and then to the extension which alerts the user with a notification, complete with essential details such as commission rates, payment methods, and cookie tracking periods.
Back on the dashboard, all discovered affiliate programs are showcased with all the relevant information. This centralized system not only streamlines workflow but also enables the export of data to CSV, PDF, or directly copy it for further use.

*** Description:
What it does

GrubScore is a lightweight mobile app designed to help make healthier eating choices. The app enables a user to snap or upload a picture of their food and get instant feedback on how healthy the food actually is, with no bias. The app can also quickly generate healthy recipes with 1-tap while respecting user defined allergens and dietary restrictions.

In the scoring tab, the user simply taps the "Analyze" button and uploads a picture from their camera or gallery for submission. Once the user confirms the photo choice, the app combines the photo with a scoring criteria text prompt to create a multimodal prompt on the backend. This prompt is then sent to the Gemini API, which returns a response that is shown to the user. This response includes the health score for the food pictured, recommendations for similar food, and possible allergens. If the food is unhealthy and scores low, the response will include recommendations for healthy alternatives that are similar to the food pictured. If the food is healthy and scores high, the response will commend the user for making healthy choices and recommend healthy foods that are similar to the food pictured.

The recipe generation tab takes user defined allergens and/or dietary restrictions if applicable and with the help of the Gemini API, generates a healthy recipe that can be copied to the clipboard or shared to other apps.

GrubScore helps take the guesswork out of healthy eating in no time all thanks to the Gemini API!

*** Description:
What it does

In the AI era, most professional and everyday tasks will be automated. Most of the general public who are not able to utilize AI will face hard times.

The vision of Promptest is to overcome any fears of using AI by facilitating prompting practice. Promptest is a prompt training platform to empower non-technical individuals to thrive in the AI future by writing efficient prompts to resolve everyday problems.

Promptest offers well-designed challenges across various topics, allowing users to practice writing prompts that guide AI systems to resolve specific problems. Efficiency is emphasized, encouraging users to craft efficient prompts using fewer words (tokens).

Each challenge consists of a situation, an input, and an expected answer. Users must write prompts that guide the AI in generating the desired response based on the input. The Gemini API plays a crucial role by not only generating results based on user prompts but also detecting invalid or contextually illogical prompts. In addition, the challenges are co-designed by humans and Gemini.

To further enhance users’ prompt-writing techniques, Promptest includes leaderboards for each question. Users can compete by submitting prompts with the fewest tokens to solve challenges. Additionally, they can learn from top prompts created by other users. This focus on improvement aligns with the core goal of the product—to empower users and reduce any apprehension about interacting with AI.

- ABSTRACT: Fantasy adventures with AI-driven stories and voice narration.

*** Description:
What it does

Journey Together is a cross-platform mobile app, built with Flutter for both Android and iOS, that offers a dynamic "create your own adventure" experience. The core of the game is an advanced AI-driven system that generates unique, immersive stories for each player, blending human creativity with AI innovation.

At the heart of Journey Together is an AI prompt mechanism that utilizes various inputs to tailor each narrative. The AI processes JSON objects that include user data (such as age and preferences), game elements (like unlocked features, equipped items, and selected avatars), and contextual information from previous stories. These inputs are fed into the AI, which then generates a script for the adventure, complete with interactive questions, challenges, and opportunities for players to use items from their inventory or explore different paths on the map.

Multiplayer functionality is supported through Firebase, where a "Host" player creates a story that others can join. Communication between players and the AI is managed via Firebase Database, ensuring real-time updates and interactions. The AI not only crafts the story but also maintains continuity by referencing details from prior adventures, enhancing immersion.

The game also features AI-generated voice narration (in English), enriching the storytelling experience. Players earn rewards as they progress, which can be used to unlock new abilities, customize avatars, and further personalize their adventures.

*** Description:
What it does

No More Jockeys: Training Game' brings this cultural figure naming game to your device, similar to how chess.com brought chess to mobile.
How to play: Players name a famous person and a relevant category, which become forbidden. If you name someone falling under a previous category, your opponent can challenge you. If correctly challenged, you're out.
Gemini's knowledge and reasoning skills make this game possible to play against a computer. Here's how it's used:
Name + Category Generation: Gemini generates a famous person, avoiding previous categories.
Reasoning: It double-checks its play, selecting from a database if necessary.
Reasoning when challenged: Gemini resigns if correctly challenged, but not for incorrect challenges.
Reasoning against opponents: It determines if the opponent's move violates categories and decides whether to challenge.
Image reasoning: Gemini can analyze images to check for category violations.
Live 'inspiration' set: Real-time data from the database of all players are injected into gemini’s generation prompts. E.g. At Christmas when more players play festive characters, Gemini will be ‘inspired’ to do the same.
Chat: Gemini converses throughout the game, being playfully competitive.
Match Report: It generates a post-match report in a sports commentator style.
This implementation showcases Gemini's versatility in:
Cultural knowledge Logical reasoning with vague or interpretable rules
Image analysis
Live adaptive prompts - a novel approach

- TITLE: Sport Sage  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Sport Sage brings you live athletic intelligence, wherever you are.

*** Description:
What it does

Sport Sage builds on the powers of Gemini to process short athletic videos. Prompting the user for brief pieces of context we then build a useful response to improve athletic performance. The application targets non-experts and is meant to act as a "rubber duck" level of help in your pocket. We prioritized fast onboarding and minimal feedback. Many folks still find AI and LLMs intimidating, so we strove to hide as much complexity as possible behind an obvious interface. Narrowing the set of things you're asking Gemini for helps contextualize the feedback and makes it nearly instantaneously useful.

The processing and understanding of the video is fairly good in cases where the video is clear and single subject. Team sports are a little more challenging and lead to less specific feedback, but it can still be useful.

After experimenting with the API, we found the default output on one and few-shot requests to be pretty good! The team is experimenting with some additional training data, but this didn't seem necessary for the prototype we built. Adding curated model intelligence are and streaming feedback sessions our primary next steps.

In terms of technologies, we used Elixir and Phoenix (with LiveView) to develop the web application.

What it does

With this application, people will be able to participate in the knowledge competition. They can either practice alone or quickly match with a random player or play with their friends. In this application, questions are instantly created in the players' current language with Gemini artificial intelligence. In this game concept, if the player answers the question correctly, he gains points as much as the opponent's score, if he answers incorrectly, he loses points as much as the opponent's score, and points can be gained or lost by guessing whether the opponent knows the question or not. Among the advanced features is cheating detection with artificial intelligence. Cheating test detection will be done with parameters such as the player's statistics and the speed of answering the question. Unfortunately, the game did not fully reach the competition. I apologize.

- TITLE: HealthRanger  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: HealthRanger is an AI co-pilot for community healthcare workers.

*** Description:
What it does

There is a massive medical crisis going on in parts of India, Africa, South America and SE Asia, especially in the rural areas. The doctor to patient ratio is so alarmingly low that doctors cannot fulfill their duties with utmost care and efficacy. Moreover rural folks are usually less tech savvy and educationally backward, leading to them not fully following doctor's advice or doing regular checkups.

Which is why CHWs exist. While their work is commendable globally, they have their own special problems. Lack of formal medical education, digital tooling and poor ratios have also led to them not being deployed super effectively. And hence HealthRanger exists.

HealthRanger augments CHWs with better tools for more effective medical surveys and referrals, automated follow-up tools and AI powered case management software at their tooltips.

How Gemini AI powers HealthRanger?

1. Gemini multimodal support helps transcribe live calls on the go. Why is this needed? Android doesn't allow speech to text beyond a certain time period. So Gemini solves this by generating live transcriptions of face to face talks.
2. Gemini's long context window analyzes hundreds of transcribed talks/calls for villages to generate summaries, sentiment reports, suggestions and alerts.
3. Gemini analyzes photos/videos/chats/transcripts and generate top notch responses based on prompts.
4. Also the Firebase extensions and Firebase Genkit make using Gemini AI super simple while prototyping and in production.

Accessing the country's detailed info directs the user to a page containing the country's basic info, an interactive generatable timeline, a historical figures section with the country's most relevant figures, a political landscape section with a brief overview of the governmental structure, notable persons in power and their positions, political parties and their ideologies, as well as other relevant historical and contemporary political trends. Then we have a cultural insights section, a landmarks section, a tour program generator section, and a generated quiz on the selected country. All provided data is generated by prompting the Gemini API, except the images, which are stored and retrieved from Firebase.

*** Description:
What it does

Have you ever left the car dealership with your car report, only to feel lost trying to understand it, or maybe misplaced those reports, making it difficult to track your car's health? Unlike high-end cars, which often come with apps for tracking health, lower-tier cars frequently lack such features, complicating their maintenance.
Our AutoSeers app addresses these issues by giving everyone the opportunity to monitor their car’s health. It allows users to upload car reports and offers a unique experience where you can view insights and information about parts of your car that need attention. Additionally, you can book appointments directly through the app to ensure your car gets the care it needs. All these features are powered by Gemini.
Thanks to Gemini, we’ve created a tailored experience that offers recommended services based on your car’s mileage, make, model, and year. With poor maintenance contributing to 2% - 12% of crashes, our goal is to reduce this number to 0%.

- ABSTRACT: Save, organise, and find anything effortlessly

*** Description:
What it does

Stowboard is your ultimate personal assistant when it comes to storing photos or bookmarking websites or making random notes at the spur of a moment. As people we tend to capture photos or bookmark sites or note down an address quickly in a notes application for later retrieval, but as time passes on we find it tough to retrieve it back. Stowboard solves this by automatically analysing the content you store and tags them so that you can perform searches like - get me the addresses that i saved or get me the photos of the cutlery i took or get me the wallet website i saved making it much for easier for the user to locate their content instead of endlessly sifting through multiple apps. When storing images the app makes use of Gemini's vision capability to identify objects within the image to create tags and summary. With links the app extracts the title, keywords and description and feeds it to the text generation capability of Gemini to create tags and summary. With text the app uses Gemini to categorise the text into address, mobile number, notes or reminders and creates a tag and summary from this. The tags and summary generated by Gemini is then converted to vector using Gemini's embedding capabilities and is stored in Redis. When the user searches for something the app converts the text into vector embedding using Gemini's embedding capabilities and does a vector based search. The app also uses Firebase auth, Firestore and Firebase cloud functions.

*** Description:
What it does

Smoothy is a prototype for displaying generative AI output using geolocated AR.

I wanted to find the right context and task where both the output values from generative AI and the physical locations in geolocated AR would be explored together. A travel-assist app made perfect sense for this, and I chose Harvard Bridge that connects Boston and Cambridge/MIT with its painted smoot markers. (For details on "smoot", please see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot)

In the Smoothy prototype, Gemini API is given a smoot marker number along the bridge, and is asked to return some relevant info with respect to MIT and that number. Geospatial Creator + Aero is then used to display the info at the location of the corresponding smoot marker.

Please note that, in the current version, Aero is not able to accept live external assets or data. Therefore I had to prototype this as 2 separate processes where I first generated the info then secondly created suitable assets for Geospatial Creator + Aero. A real-time version would be possible with Aero if a future version allows for live data access.

The API’s response is converted into speech using text-to-speech functionality, allowing users to hear a clear and concise description of what’s around them. This continuous loop ensures that users receive up-to-date information about their environment, helping them navigate more confidently and independently.

Cupid Chat Cue is a service I created to help people keep their conversations with a crush or someone they’re interested in both engaging and smooth. With Cupid Chat Cue, awkward silences and lost interest are things of the past. When a user uploads a chat screenshot, the service analyzes the conversation’s context and provides tailored, witty, and charming replies that fit naturally into the ongoing dialogue.

I used the Gemini API to make this possible. Through Google AI Studio, I trained Gemini on a vast array of social media interactions, books, and guides on dating conversations. This training process allowed me to fine-tune the model so that it not only understands the context of the uploaded chat but also offers responses that are specifically designed to keep the conversation lively and interesting. Instead of generic suggestions, the replies are personalized to match the tone, style, and flow of the user’s chat. Whether you’re trying to impress a new crush or keep a long-term connection exciting, Cupid Chat Cue ensures that you always know the right thing to say to keep the conversation sparkling.

Introduction

Good afternoon, jurors. I present an innovative app that summarizes PDFs and facilitates communication with chatbots. I believe this tool has the potential to make a significant impact on the way people access and process information, and I hope its inclusion in the Gemini AI premium awards is crucial to its success.

The problem:

Lengthy and complex PDFs can be difficult to read and understand, limiting learning and professional development.


Differentiators:

High-quality summaries: Our algorithm ensures that summaries are accurate, informative, and easy to understand.
Conversational translation: The app translates the summaries into the user's language, allowing them to talk to the chatbot about the content in a natural way.
Token control: Aware of the token limitation in the Gemini prompt, we offer the option to adjust the summary size, allowing the user to find the ideal balance between quality and quantity of information.
Impact:

We believe our app has the potential to make a significant impact in several areas:

Education: Facilitating learning through concise summaries of complex teaching materials.
Research: Assisting researchers in quickly understanding scientific articles and technical documents.


Demonstration:

I invite you to test our application in real time. Bring your PDFs and together we can see how he transforms complex information into accessible knowledge.

- ABSTRACT: This app suggests recipes with a focus on protein intake.

*** Description:
What it does

Application for Gemini API Utilization Global Competition

Did you know?
The appetite of living organisms is governed by protein intake.
Living organisms will continue to eat until they consume the required amount of protein.
Conversely, if the necessary protein is consumed, the appetite can be suppressed.
For those who want to know more about this, I recommend reading the book "Eat Like the Animals: What Nature Teaches Us about the Science of Healthy Eating."

I was so struck by this fact that I created a recipe suggestion app using Gemini API.

Features:

Created with Python and Streamlit
Calculates your daily basal metabolic rate (calories) and required protein intake based on your age, height, weight, and gender
Allows you to upload images of the contents of your refrigerator or ingredients to analyze the available ingredients from the images
Suggests optimal recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner) based on the ingredient data, basal metabolic rate, and required protein intake
Gemini-API:

Uses an API to analyze images.
Utilizes standard generative AI.

*** Description:
What it does

Cart Genie utilizes Gemini to help you scan and record grocery prices as you shop. Check off an item on your list and if Genie hasn't seen the product before, it gathers all the product info it can using Gemini and creates a new product in your collection. After that, it uses Gemini to read the price picture you captured for and add that price point to the product.

Use genie every time you shop and pretty soon you'll know if the sale price you see in front of you at the store is actually a decent price. If you shop at multiple stores you'll start to see where is the cheapest place for you to go shopping.

Genie also helps to know the unit price of items so you can decide if that case of peanut butter is actually cheaper than the the single jar.

- TITLE: outdraw.AI  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Human vs AI party game: Draw in ways humans get but AI can&#39;t decipher!

*** Description:
What it does

outdraw.AI is a human vs AI party game for 2-6 people where players take turns drawing prompts in ways only humans can decipher, but an AI can't. In each round, one player chooses a prompt, such as cat or capitalism, and must draw it in a way that will fool an AI, but not their fellow humans! Once the drawing is done, all of the guessers, including the AI, will try to guess the word. If any humans guess right, and the AI is tricked, then humans win! But if the AI guesses right, then humans lose!

This game requires a collaborative effort between the participants to push their creativity and deviate from what the AI has already learned. Promoting its potential as a collaborative tool that seeks not to replace human creativity but to enhance it.

Powered by Gemini 1.5 Pro's advanced image recognition, the game processes each completed drawing through the Gemini API, which returns the most likely interpretations, seamlessly integrating into gameplay. Our project has made a significant global impact, sparking discussions about AI and creativity across both the arts and gaming sectors through international exhibitions. Since its debut at Civic Creative Base Tokyo, it has been featured at renowned events including Now Play This (London), Ars Electronica (Linz), and the Asian Art Museum (San Francisco), attracting attention from media outlets like The Guardian and IGN. Building on this success, an online playable version is set for Steam release in winter 2024.

What it does

"Companion" is a Chrome extension designed to make the web more accessible and user-friendly, particularly for individuals with visual impairments, cognitive disabilities, or language barriers. The app leverages the Gemini API to simplify complex web content, making it more digestible and easier to understand.

The core idea of Companion is to grant Gemini direct access to your current tab's web content, enabling it to provide relevant answers to the exact content you are currently viewing. Currently, the app supports a basic multi-modality with Gemini, allowing you to prompt Gemini with an image and text and receive a text-based response. Future plans include expanding this capability to process multiple images, videos, and audio, as well as generating images to help illustrate web content.

A feature that exemplifies the direction of the app is its ability to understand and respond to voice commands in hover mode. In this mode, Gemini interprets voice commands in relation to user-selected content, providing context-aware responses that align with the ongoing conversation.

Users can also adjust Gemini's responses according to their preferences. For example, you can ask Gemini to simplify information, offer follow-up questions to deepen understanding, or translate content into chosen languages. This extension aims not only to make the web more navigable but also to enhance daily experiences by removing barriers to digital content.

This organization allows for efficient processing and understanding of webpage content.

Intent Recognition and Navigation: The Gemini API also plays a crucial role in understanding user instructions. It processes voice input to detect the user's intent and identifies the corresponding target node within the tree structure. The API categorizes user commands into six intents: navigating to a website, summarization, reading content, querying information, clicking elements, and filling out forms.

By leveraging these capabilities, the app enables users to perform a variety of web-based tasks through voice commands and gestures, making the browsing experience more accessible and intuitive.

- TITLE: Gemini-powered Workout Tracking App  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Create tailored workout routines using Gemini

*** Description:
What it does

Allows users to record workout routines, track completion of these routines, and edit these routines. Gemini is used to offer an alternative way to create workout routines, where a user can request what kind of workout they want, and Gemini will generate one. Gemini is grounded in the user’s completed workout routine history, so can provide workout routines that are tailored to the user’s level of experience. Additionally, it can also act like a coach, and suggest workout routines which up the intensity of previously completed workout routines if the user asks it.

The app itself does not call Gemini, this is done by the backend API which supports the app. This API manages the data consumed by the app, such as the workouts associated with each user. The app makes a call to one of the API’s endpoints which invokes a call to Gemini. LangChain is used to call Gemini. LangChain calls Gemini using the Google Cloud Python SDK. LangChain is used to additionally implement Prompt Engineering, RAG, and Function Calling. Gemini is made aware of the user’s request, user workout history, exercises supported by the backend API, the request format of the backend API’s create workout endpoint, and a tool to actually call this endpoint. The outcome is that Gemini enters a new workout into the backend database for this user, and then the Android app refreshes its data from the backend API, which then contains this generated workout.

Users can also change their preferred language, level of summary, and policy interests to make the app more suited to them. Lastly, they can search for bills stored on our Cloud Firestore database.

We utilize the Gemini 1.5 flash model in iCongress for three primary purposes. First, to generate three summaries for each congressional bill that vary in depth. To do so, we feed the model the full bill text and gave it a prompt that detailed the depth of each summary level, a potential user persona for each level and instructions to ensure there is no political bias in the summaries. To ensure that we stay true to the bill text, the temperature of model was set to 0.2. Second, to translate these summaries to a user’s preferred language. Third, in a chatbot that utilizes a given bill’s text to answer the user’s questions in a concise manner.

- ABSTRACT: Reveal your cat&#39;s destiny by scanning their paws with Toebeans!

*** Description:
What it does

Toebeans is a fun app for getting different types of fortunes for your pet cat. It can generate paw readings, horoscopes, tell you about their past lives, and you can ask it some predefined questions. The app is currently a work-in-progress, and is planned to be released in the fall. Toebeans is a Compose Multiplatform app that targets both Android and iOS. On the Android side it uses MediaPipe's object detection to detect the cats paws either by consuming the camera feed or from a selected image.

Once we have a picture of the paw (toebeans) the user can then get different fortunes for their cat. On Android it uses VertexAI and Gemini to generate the response from the given fortune prompt. On iOS it uses Firebase Functions to call the Gemini API. This is done because currently the VertexAI package for iOS is written in swift and not compatible with Kotlin Multiplatform. Toebeans also uses Firebase Remote Config to be able to adjust the prompt parameters and model settings remotely. As well as Firebase Auth for user authentication (currently disabled).

The user is also able to "modify" their original fortune response to a different type. The app then takes the original response and tells Gemini to rewrite it in a different style.

The plan for the future is to use GenKit instead of VertexAI and Firebase functions. We are also in the process of tuning a Gemini model by using the AI studio.

*** Description:
What it does

Mimeline is a free lifelogging app that automatically records users' activities and allows them to enhance their logs with photos and text, creating diary-like records. It is designed for anyone who wants to keep track of their activities, but it is particularly well-suited for business users and travelers who need to add information to their chronological data. This app is designed with sophisticated accessibility features and user interface, ensuring that all users can operate it intuitively and easily. In addition to this, by not using cloud servers, it protects personal information and reduces the waste of resources from data transfer and energy consumption, resulting in fast and efficient performance.

Adaptive View, powered by Gemini, generates functional HTML within the app to visualize users' lifelogs. It allows even those unfamiliar with LLMs to easily create interactive and rich outputs. For example, users can plot activities on Google Maps, compile logs into tables, and generate functional buttons, enabling features not originally available in the app. Gemini is utilized in two distinct roles: as a Validator (Gemini 1.5 Pro / responseMimeType: json) to organize prompts and conditions, and as an Editor (Gemini 1.5 Flash) to generate text. Combining these AIs' results allows for fast, cost-effective HTML generation. In addition, this approach addresses the issue of erroneous code generation that can occur with general LLMs, ensuring stable and reliable code output.

This enables the app to provide tailored maintenance suggestions based on the actual condition of the vehicle as seen in the images. The ViewModel handles these image-based requests, ensuring accurate and relevant insights. (Work in progress)

The app uses a modular architecture, dividing the code into app, data, and domain layers for better scalability and maintenance. Firebase supports user authentication and Crashlytics monitors app stability, while Kotlin libraries manage JSON serialization and ViewModel lifecycles. This combination of technologies makes the app a comprehensive tool for motorcycle maintenance.

- TITLE: Dazzle  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Dazzle creates convenient AI app shortcuts.

*** Description:
What it does

Dazzle allows users to save a predefined AI prompt as a shortcut on their homescreen. This is accomplished by making the site a PWA, which allows the user to download the website. On phones, the shortcut appears just like any other app.

For example, the user can store a prompt such as "Translate this to English", then name their app "Translator" and save it on their homescreen. When they run their app, it will open with a view of their camera feed. Then they click the "Analyze" button which sends their original prompt, along with a screenshot from their camera, to the Gemini API and the response is shown on the screen. In this case, if they point their phone camera to some French text and click "Analyze", the English translation will be returned from Gemini API and shown in the app.

- TITLE: Learn It  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Teaching where teachers are scarce!

*** Description:
What it does

Learn It is an on-demand learning platform for students without the gift of education in
remote and deprived areas. We believe people are all created equal, and technology helps
us provide equal opportunities to all.

The inclusive nature also helps them catch up with the modern world while providing the
students with a customized environment in which to learn, so every student feels right at
home with their language, culture, and skill choice.

We take the interests of our students, generate a quiz using Gemini to understand their
current standing on the subject matter, and then generate the outline of their path from
beginner to expert that can make a difference in the world.

Our approach to learning is to learn by doing, students perform tests that are customized for
people according to their culture, gender identity, and disabilities, which are generated via
Gemini. They get an explanation for each question and each answer, which allows every
student to reach their full potential, regardless of their circumstances.

Our learning method is fun, free and effective. Let's share this gift with the world with the
help of Google Gemini.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app is designed to help low-income patients who lack insurance coverage quickly get reimbursed for their healthcare expenses. Users simply take photos of their medical bills using their smartphone. We then use Gemini to analyze these documents. Gemini identifies the document type and extracts key information like patient name and cost. This allows us to process claims much faster than traditional methods. Once verified, we initiate reimbursements, typically reaching users' accounts within 1-3 days. By dramatically reducing the waiting time for reimbursements, we are helping ensure that financial constraints don't prevent people from getting necessary medical care. As a not-for-profit organization, we are committed to making healthcare more accessible and affordable for those who need it most

According to an article in The Economist (https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/25/how-to-make-air-conditioning-more-sustainable) making air conditioners more energy efficient could reduce carbon emissions by 180 billion tons by the year 2050. Lowering the use of air conditioners can go a long way to helping climate change (and lowering your power bill). How can you run your air conditioner less? simple: Open the windows in your home whenever possible. You can use Crossover to send you notifications about when the humidity and temperature are comfortable for opening the windows in your house.
Crossover strives to give users actionable weather data in an easy-to-consume format for the weather that they care about the most. Gemini is used to collect the data from the user needed to get the customized weather forecast (such as zip code what weather the user wants to know about). Once the user goes through the initial set up process, they will recieve a notification that tells them when to expect the dewpoint or the temperature in their area to "Crossover" their target temperature over the next several days. Additionally, to expidite the development of the project, we integrated with Pushover as the only method of getting notified. You will need to sign up for a free pushover account to get the needed User API key and Pushover API Keys.

What it does

Keptune AI helps scientists and researchers analyze their data by automating tedious data-cleaning tasks, running statistical tests, making charts, etc. using natural language prompting. It offers a simple yet powerful alternative to apps like Excel, SPSS, Tableau, Prism, and Origin. The idea for this app came out of my professional experience as a Scientific Software Engineer who wrote custom apps and scripts for scientists to save them several hours per week by automating repetitive data cleaning and analysis tasks. With the help of Gemini API, Keptune aims to make it possible for every scientist to write custom data analysis workflows tailored specifically to their needs.

Keptune AI talks to the Gemini API on the backend to plan the analysis steps, write Python code to accomplish each step, and offer suggestions for follow-up analysis. Because the code is generated on demand, thanks to the Gemini API, there is infinite flexibility in the types of analyses that can be automated. Users also have the option of editing and re-running any code generated by the Gemini model. This combination of natural language prompting along with the code editing capability makes it an ideal tool for both beginners and experts. The python code is run in the browser using Pyodide (a port of CPython to WebAssembly) so there is no need to provision virtual machines for users, making it cost-effective to run this app at scale.

*** Description:
What it does

Atmosphere interacts with the Google Gemini Flash API in 2 independent steps to generate immersive and cohesive audio recordings.
Step 1: Timestamps
Initially, Atmosphere is provided with the audio recording in its entirety, and is tasked with locating timestamps within the audio book that correspond to scenes that would be enhanced by ambient audio. In addition to providing the timestamp of these scenes, Gemini also produces a concise description of the context of the scene, and salient keywords from the scene that construct the overall tone of the segment.
Step 2: Mappings
Using the keywords gathered for each scene identified by Gemini, Atmosphere sifts through the 33,000+ sound effects and their associated keywords in the BBC sound effects library, and acquires all sounds with at least one keyword matching that of the scene. With all sound effects a minimum of one matching keyword compiled into a list, Gemini is prompted to pick the sound from the list that best matches the scene description created by Gemini in step 1.
Step 3: Overlay
Once all sounds have been selected for each scene, Atmosphere normalizes, fades, trims then overlays the selected sound effects onto the corresponding audio book segments.

I created this tool because it can be helpful to teachers, students, researchers, etc. As many teachers believe in the content written in the books rather than on the internet, so I build this application. With Q&A for Academics, you can ask a question or provide a topic and upload a PDF document. Our system uses the Gemini 1.5 Pro API to deliver precise answers based solely on the document's content. [Add-on] Computer vision which is an advanced branch of digital image processing is used to extract the visual contents from the pdf file. Additionally, if the document contains any figures, diagrams, images, or tables, our tool will extract these visuals. My goal is to make the process of finding and understanding academic information straightforward and comprehensive. I hope that my tool will enhance your academic journey by providing clear and informative responses to your queries. I used this tool for my END Sem examination in NIT Kurukshetra, and I got A grade (9 out of 10) in all the subjects which is a really great thing for me. Thank you!

*** Description:
What it does

This web application leverages Go as the backend programming language, chosen specifically for its compatibility with the Go GenAI SDK, which facilitates the interaction with machine learning models, particularly in handling and analyzing images. The primary functionality of this app involves uploading satellite images sourced from NASA's Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS), available at [NASA's EarthData website](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/science-system-description/eosdis-components/gibs). These satellite images provide high-resolution, near-real-time visual data of Earth's surface, making them valuable for various environmental monitoring purposes.
The choice of Go as the backend language is strategic. Go, known for its efficiency and simplicity, is particularly well-suited for handling concurrent tasks, which is crucial when processing large image files and interacting with models. The Go GenAI SDK further enhances this by providing a seamless interface to send these images to AI models for analysis. This integration allows the application to perform complex image recognition and analysis tasks, which would be resource-intensive and complex to implement from scratch.

*** Description:
What it does

AISOS (AI Save Our Souls) streamlines medical workflows by automating the entry of electronic medical records (EMRs), reducing the inefficiencies of manual data entry.

Traditionally, doctors take notes during consultations and later input this information into EMRs, a time-consuming process prone to errors. AISOS solves this problem with Gemini’s advanced multimodal capabilities, which allow the development of a high-precision application accessible via smartphone and PC.

The smartphone app records doctor-patient conversations in real-time, sending the audio data to a backend server for processing. Gemini's key role is to analyze the audio and extract essential information for EMR entry, accurately interpreting various dialects, languages, and measurement units.

This allows doctors and patients to communicate in their preferred language, ensuring accurate medical documentation without manual conversion errors. AISOS requires only audio input, making it easier for patients from diverse backgrounds to receive care.

For example, in a Japanese hospital requiring EMR entries in Japanese, AISOS can process an English-speaking patient's input, convert measurements, and generate parsed data in Japanese for the EMR.

AISOS, powered by Gemini, enhances medical efficiency and ensures smooth, stress-free patient interactions, making high-quality care more accessible worldwide.

- ABSTRACT: GLOD, where your business meets AI-powered creativity and productivity

*** Description:
What it does

GLOD AI produces high-quality marketing video production by using the Gemini API.
Phase 1: User Input
Users provide GLOD AI with their product information, any special requests on video to be produced (optional), and the desired resolution.
Phase 2: Generate Scripts
GLOD AI uses the Gemini API to create scripts for videos. This includes prompts for AI-generated images, AI video generation, voice-overs, voice tones, mood, and background music styles.
Phase 3: Generate Images
Two types of images will be generated: one without the product and another with the product. For images with the product, the background will be removed, and new background images will be created. These images will be adjusted to match the newly generated background. Images without the product are generated based on the script.
Phase 4.a: Generate voice-over, Subtitles, and Music
Voice-over and subtitles will be generated and synchronized with the video, and background music will also be generated, all based on the script that Gemini created.
Phase 4.b: Generate Videos & Compilation
Video clips will be generated using the images from Phase 3 and the script. These clips will then be compiled into a seamless sequence, ensuring smooth transitions and narrative coherence.
Phase 5: Final Combination
All elements—combined video without audio, voice-over, subtitles, and music—are integrated into a cohesive final product.

*** Description:
What it does

My application leverages Gemini's natural language capabilities to empower marginalized/non-marginalized farmers. Using sensors that collect real-time data and feed it to Firebase, the system monitors specific plots or hydroponic tanks. This data, accessible to the Gemini API, is integrated with a WhatsApp interface to reach farmers who may not have access to advanced AI tools but regularly use WhatsApp.

The system includes three CNN-trained TensorFlow models capable of classifying four tomato diseases, three potato diseases, and six maize diseases. Farmers interact with these models through WhatsApp. When a disease is predicted, the model provides a class and confidence level, which Gemini translates into understandable language. Gemini engages with farmers in a friendly manner, offering insights to improve crop health, reduce pesticide use, and explore alternative farming methods.

I've also implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities, embedding PDF data on farming practices and crop management. When the agent is not confident in an answer, it uses Exa to search the internet for accurate information. By maintaining context about each farmer's plot through Firebase IoT data, Gemini offers personalized recommendations, helping farmers grow more nutritious food and supporting sustainable practices.

*** Description:
What it does

"Casual Chit-Chat" is not just any chat app. With the reliable manager Nancy, powered by GeminiAPI, you can enjoy smooth conversations in any situation.

For example, when you join a chat where others are already deep in conversation, it might feel a bit daunting to jump in. However, with Nancy's help, she summarizes the chat log and eases you into the conversation. If the conversation stalls or if someone hasn't spoken much, Nancy will gently prompt them, ensuring everyone feels included.

When the conversation isn't lively, Nancy suggests topics to keep the chat going. Additionally, if you've set up your profile, Nancy will use that information to start conversations, providing new and engaging discussion points. Other users may join in, making the conversation more dynamic.

The key point is that Nancy, powered by GeminiAPI, is not the star of the show. She acts as a facilitator, helping users engage in warm, friendly conversations with ease.

"Casual Chit-Chat" aims to provide a relaxed chat environment where you can comfortably participate, whether you're entering for the first time or joining mid-discussion. Thanks to Nancy, everyone can join in and enjoy pleasant conversations. Come and experience new encounters and delightful chats with "Casual Chit-Chat".

*** Description:
What it does

Our application uses the Gemini API to recommend movies based on an initial prompt provided by the user. This prompt can be of any type, including movie categories, actor names, awards, or any other parameter the user wishes.

The backend is developed in Node.js with TypeScript, ensuring robust and scalable performance. We leverage Google Cloud Functions to handle the submission of the search prompt. Once the prompt is received, the Gemini API processes it and curates a list of movies that best align with the given criteria.

After Gemini identifies the ideal movie, the application interacts with the IMDB API, which returns the movie's title, synopsis, and cover image. By analyzing the context of the prompt, the Gemini API searches its database and provides precise and relevant results.

This seamless integration ensures a highly personalized user experience, allowing users to discover new movies or revisit classics that perfectly match their interests or current mood. The combination of flexibility in the initial prompt with accuracy in recommendations makes the application a powerful tool for movie lovers.

What it does

Cloudiff AI is the first step in Zero Touch Governance, Audit, Security, Financial Control and Complete Management of Hybrid Cloud Platform. We are a collection of Platform Engineers with 20 years experience and managing hybrid cloud platforms is a problem we want to solve now.
Getting the right information about your platform at your fingertips through a human interface without IT support enables the business to make fast informed decisions and run realtime audits. We believe this will be used from C-Suite making critical decisions down to engineers onboarding to a new platform and learning the environment they work in.
Gemini has allowed us to use a graph of real world problems and give it a brain that understands all the complex information and their relationship. Abstracting complex data models and decoupling insightful information from manual effort. Our RAG based LLM solves a real world problem using Gemini. Throughout the six week build and test there are things to fix. We are currently bootstrapped so our app is running in Cloud Run that scales to 0 so sometimes the first ping hangs. We will be making the app more efficient in the frontend and a C++ wrapper to replace our Python wrapper. As a business we believe Cloudiff has potential to step forward from read-only insights into a world where it builds and manages the platforms. We believe it can also do predictive analysis on platforms including financial forecasting and recommend security improvements.

*** Description:
What it does

MeetMidway is a web application designed to simplify the logistics of organizing meetups. To provide the best recommendations, the application collects information about each user’s interests, and allows users to select and rank their favorite activities from a provided list. The MeetMidway algorithm then considers everyone’s preferences and suggests the best activities around a midway point and prioritizes some others based on Google ratings, and how it best suits the user preferences. This midpoint is calculated as the geometric median of all participants’ latitude and longitude values from their inputted addresses. We used various Google Maps APIs including: the Places, Geocoding, and the Roads API. The Places API was used to gather information about every single place around a certain radius of the midpoint. The Geocoding API was used to convert addresses into coordinates. In this app, it also generates directions using the Roads API to the midpoint for each friend and searches for activities in the area. We utilized Gemini twice in the app. Gemini is used to filter out all the places that Places API originally generated, to best suit user preferences. Furthermore, Gemini was used to generate a personalized itinerary, prioritizing Google ratings as well as prioritizing how well the places match the preferences. If users aren’t satisfied with the suggested itinerary, they can summon Gemini again to regenerate the travel plan to better suit their needs.

*** Description:
What it does

The app is named Commpain't, a combination of "Community" and "Paint". The point between "pain" and "t" symbolizes healing pain by painting over it.
As community participation increasingly moves online, elderly individuals or those with disabilities who struggle with typing might find it challenging to engage. This app aims to make participation easier by allowing users to express their thoughts through Gemini-powered voice interactions.
When users click "Solve your problems with your community!", they enter into a conversation with a virtual character named MinJi, powered by the Gemini 1.5 flash model. If the conversation extends beyond three exchanges, the AI automatically generates a title, content, and topic based on the discussion, which can then be posted.
Initially, a new post's status is set to "In progress". Once it receives 10 or more hearts, regional supporters can change its status to "Approved". To become a supporter, users can click the vote image button next to the search bar to see the top 5 supporter candidates in their region, based on the number of hearts received. Three of these candidates are then selected as official supporters.
Supporters can leave answering posts on approved content. If the original poster selects an answer as a "great answer", the post's status changes to "Paint done!".
Everybody can support and grow together with your community in this app.

- ABSTRACT: Anthropomorphize anything - speak with your pets, paintings, and more

*** Description:
What it does

We were inspired by the Google Project Astra product demo but wanted to change the system prompt to try new and fun use cases. Unfortunately, Astra is not released yet nor would it have an API with system prompt manipulation so we set out to create our own open source version.

For a starting use case we use a series of AI models to allow users to interact with their surroundings in new and entertaining ways! Specifically, they can anthropomorphize anything, from their pet dog/cat, to a painting on a wall, to their coffee they are drinking. The user clicks on an object which we create a mask over using TensorFlow models and send the cutout of the object along with the background as two images to Gemini Flash (see https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/interactive_segmenter). Gemini identifies the object and we start a new Gemini stream chat where the system prompt informs Gemini of it's new role (e.g. the painting on the wall). The user can then converse with this new anthropomorphized object / animal.

We use voice-activity-detection (VAD) to identify when the user is speaking and, after 1.3 seconds of silence, we send the latest screen capture of their camera along with the audio to Gemini to continue the conversation. When Gemini responds, the text is converted to speech using ElevenLabs text-to-speech streaming API. Between Google image segmenter, optical flow, Gemini Flash (twice), VAD, and text-to-speech, we use 6 AI models in our pipeline.

*** Description:
What it does

My app is a fun and interactive platform for writing and sharing stories. After signing in and creating an account, users can dive into their own creative space to start writing novels. The home page is your gateway to adventure—read stories from other users or get started on your own.
There’s a story prompt generator on the left side of the home page. Just click on it, and you'll be taken to the CreateDocument page with a text editor, where the magic happens. In the editor, pressing the Tab key will generate new text to keep your story going. You can even choose an AI partner to switch up the themes and style of the text that gets generated, making your story truly unique.
I integrated the Gemini API to help with the writing process. It helps users by generating text, making sure what’s created flows naturally with your story. Plus, it helps keep the content clean and safe, so you can focus on the fun parts—like crafting an epic tale or diving into someone else’s world. Whether you’re here to write, read, or both, this app is all about creativity and connection.
I'm using firebase for the backend, react & typescript for the front end. I used different prompts for the Gemini API to generate text. I'm also using the perspective API to make sure that the titles are safe. I plan to add more features such as editing, autosave, collaboration, image generation and much mode.

*** Description:
What it does

I have created a system that uses Google's latest AI model, Gemini, to generate video tales for kids. The AI model creates the story and image prompts, which are then passed to Mini DALL-E, powered by Google TPU Research Cloud on Hugging Face. The backend is built with Python 3, FastAPI, and Uvicorn. Once the images are created, the text of the tale is processed by /coqui-ai/TTS, installed on a machine hosted by Contabo, to generate a WAV/MP3 file that matches the video length. All elements are combined using MoviePy and returned to the user. Users interact via a POST endpoint that accepts prompts for one or multiple characters and returns the generated videos, which are stored as static files. A background job clears space in case of failures or if videos are older than 30 days. The frontend, built with React Native, features a simple UI with a video player, a random generation button on the home page, and a custom generation option on the create page, supporting up to two characters or a preselected one from a list. The app, designed for use by children or supervisors, is currently in testing and expected to be in production on the Play Store soon.

*** Description:
What it does

As large language models (LLMs) are integrated into more services, it's important to recognize their potential to provide incorrect information confidently, a phenomenon known as "hallucination." Users should be cautious, as LLMs are not always accurate. However, Retriever Augmented Generation (RAG) can reduce these risks by using additional data to improve response accuracy. To demonstrate the differences between LLMs and RAG-enhanced AI, we created an app featuring the "Anpanman" anime. The app compares two AIs: one using only LLM and the other with RAG. The RAG-enhanced AI provided more accurate answers, highlighting the benefits of this technology in delivering correct information. This app aims to educate users about LLM limitations and the advantages of RAG.

- TITLE: Instacap  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Get AI-powered captions for your next social media post, seamlessly

*** Description:
What it does

- UNIQUE SELLING POINT: Instacap bridges the “platform gap” that with existing AI-based caption products: current solutions are not mobile-first, but users prefer mobile to store images and post to their social media.
- IMPACT: By lowering the barriers to posting, users will engage more with followers via reacts, comments, DMs. This can help repositioning existing social media from a doom-scrolling service to a more peer-based content feed.
UX DIFFERENTIATORS: Instcap is Progressive Web App (PWA) built on React, to enable a mobile-first experience without app store download. Users can still experience native-like features such as splash screens, hidden browser bars, and fast rendering.
BEST PRACTICES: Uses a serverless architecture enabled by Firebase Cloud Functions and Remote Config. This lightweight approach improves performance by performing intensive operations offboard. At the same time, the developer can update sys. instructions & model configs without redeploys to adapt to the fast-evolving AI space.
- GEMINI API USAGE: Uses few-shot techniques based on a curated caption dataset. Leverages Gemini’s multi-turn conversation ability to append previous context, so that the user does not see duplicate captions in a session.
- V2 features: Consider transitioning from few-shot to fine-tuning based on dataset size, allowing context injection for non-obvious terms (e.g., “New Year’s Eve”), and enhancing account features like saving captions and tracking caption generation.

*** Description:
What it does

Bot Or Not presents players with a series of images with a description from recent news articles to leave short comments on. Players can then look at comments made by either other players, or by Gemini's chatbot - and win points if they guess which the poster was correctly, or if their comments fooled other players in thinking they were bots.

The news API being used returns image links as well as descriptions from articles related to a topic the player can toggle through - these images and their corresponding description are used to generate content using the gemini-1.5-flash-latest generative model. Variation in the bot comments comes from a using one of a random selection of system instructions asking the chatbot to adopt various personas/mannerisms of speech - all intended to mimic comments players would leave. The generation request is made with a simple "What are your thoughts on seeing this image?"

All images/artwork for the app was generated using Gemini as well 😌

- ABSTRACT: Generate accurate NPC dialogue with Gemini AI and dynamic metadata.

*** Description:
What it does

NPC Dialogue Master AI streamlines the creation of dynamic and contextually accurate NPC dialogue for game developers. The core functionality of our app is to generate rich, evolving NPC interactions by leveraging the Gemini API, specifically the Gemini Text Model and Gemini Semantic Retrieval.

The process begins with developers structuring their game’s lore using a standard wiki format. Gemini Semantic Retrieval is used to index and categorize this lore, ensuring that all relevant details such as characters, locations, ect, are easily accessible.

Using our UI form, developers can define the purpose, personality, and context of each NPC by selecting from the same metadata used during the lore upload. This ensures that every dialogue is generated with the most accurate and relevant information. Once the NPC setup is complete, the UI generates a JSON object containing all the necessary parameters.

This JSON object is then integrated into Unreal Engine, where, during gameplay, Semantic Retrieval gathers the most relevant context, which is subsequently incorporated into the Gemini Text Model request. This process allows for dynamically generated NPC dialogue in real-time, ensuring that NPCs consistently reflect the latest updates in the game’s world, without requiring manual script revisions.

NPC Dialogue Master AI thus simplifies the dialogue creation process, enabling developers to maintain narrative consistency while focusing on building engaging and immersive game worlds.

*** Description:
What it does

Vobu is a vocabulary learning app that leverages the capabilities of GEMINI to create a personalized and immersive learning experience. It starts when users search for a word, with GEMINI AI validating its accuracy, spelling, and language. Once validated, GEMINI provides a detailed definition, example sentences, and categorizes the word, setting a solid foundation for learning.

After reviewing the word, users can enter Story Learning mode, where GEMINI AI enhances understanding by generating synonyms, antonyms, and contextually related words, all tailored to the user’s language level and personal details like interests and profession. Users select one synonym, antonym, and related word they already know, connecting the new word with their existing knowledge. GEMINI AI then crafts a personalized story that integrates the new vocabulary into a meaningful context, making learning enjoyable and improving retention. This is followed by questions to reinforce understanding.

To ensure the word is embedded in memory, Vobu offers spaced repetition. After Story Learning, users initiate this automated process where GEMINI AI generates example sentences. Notifications, managed by FCM, are sent at optimal intervals—1, 3, 7, 14, and 30 days—prompting users to review and practice the word through recall exercises.

Overall, Vobu integrates GEMINI throughout, turning vocabulary expansion into a personalized, engaging, and effective journey, ensuring each word is deeply ingrained in memory.

*** Description:
What it does

Yapper addresses the challenge researchers face in manually reading and extracting data from the overwhelming number of scientific papers published each month. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to errors, making it difficult to systematically gather and analyze relevant information.
Yapper automates the extraction and organization of data from scientific literature, with an initial focus on plant sciences, compounds, and their roles in human health. Powered by the Gemini API, Yapper allows researchers to effortlessly search, filter, and sort through critical information.
How It Works:
* We scrape abstract data from sources like Nature and PubMed.
* Using Gemini's gemini-1.5-flash-latest model, we extract plant names, compound names, and their roles from the abstracts.
* A self-validation loop, also powered by Gemini, ensures the accuracy of the extracted data, cross-referencing it against the original abstracts.
* Data that passes the validation loop is stored in Firebase Cloud Firestore. Algolia automaticaly indexed new entry in the database,
* The frontend, hosted on Vercel, presents the final, validated data to the user.
Yapper is designed to streamline the research process, reducing the effort required to analyze scientific papers and accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.

*** Description:
What it does

The 3D Plant Facility Simulator is an educational application designed to immerse students in a virtual industrial environment from day one of their training. Built in PlayCanvas, the app allows users to navigate a fully interactive 3D plant facility, featuring hydraulic pumps, electric motors, a mixer, an electric cabin, and various valves. A central guide mark helps users explore the facility by highlighting key objects and suggesting questions to ask the integrated AI-driven chatbot.

The chatbot is a critical feature of the app, offering real-time, contextually relevant answers to technical questions about the plant's components. To achieve this, we utilized the Gemini API to create high-quality embeddings from a carefully curated knowledge base. When a user poses a question, it is sent from PlayCanvas to a Python server hosted on PythonAnywhere via Flask. The server then processes the question using the Gemini API to generate embeddings, which are stored and managed in Pinecone’s vector storage. These embeddings are crucial in helping the chatbot understand and retrieve the most relevant information. Finally, using Langchain, the app generates accurate and educational responses tailored to the user’s query.

This innovative approach helps bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, making it easier for instructors to teach and for students to learn complex industrial concepts in a more engaging and interactive way.

This process continues until the entire recording is processed. At the end, all the minute-by-minute notes are compiled into a comprehensive summary, which is then summarized by Gemini.
This approach allows Jazba AI to efficiently handle videos of varying lengths, from 15 minutes to 2 hours. However, I had occasional problems with the Gemini API when generating JSON output for the final summary. To resolve this, I used openai api, which worked fine, i am sorry.
Also, Jazba AI offers the ability to create infinite AI-generated quizzes based on the notes, enhancing the interactive learning experience.

*** Description:
What it does

This is an app for journaling, meditation, and posture detection. These features might seem unrelated, but they are all methods that can help us enhance our mind, body, and spirit. Let me explain the role Gemini plays in each of these functions.

First, for posture detection, we capture a frame from the screen every 10 seconds and combine it with textual descriptions. Because we need quick feedback, we ultimately chose Gemini-1.5-flash to provide feedback.

Next, for meditation, we have users input their feelings before and after meditation. Based on these before-and-after inputs, Gemini will generate a brief summary.

Lastly, for journaling, you can record your daily life activities. The GemiLife Assistant, connected to Gemini, will provide short feedback within 10 words based on your daily entries. After a week of journaling, on the Review screen, Gemini will generate a weekly recap, offering actionable improvements and suggestions to help users reflect and grow.

That's the significant role Gemini plays in GemiLife. Thank you for your attention

*** Description:
What it does

Statistically Speaking bridge between human intuition and complex datasets, utilizing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to democratize data analysis. By providing a natural language interface, users can effortlessly pose intricate queries about their data, without requiring SQL expertise.

Features:
1.Natural Language Querying: Users can interact with the application using plain language, allowing for intuitive exploration of data.
2.LLM-Driven Data Access: The LLM translates natural language queries into SQL statements, efficiently retrieving relevant data from the underlying database.
3.User-Friendly Interface: A visually appealing and intuitive interface enhances the user experience, making data exploration accessible to a wide audience.

We utilized Gemini's Natural language capabilities by asking the model to convert English words into a actual database query. These query will be directly used on the database.
How this works:
We provide the context of the database to LLM to let it know the schema and how data are organized in our database. This will help the LLM to give correct query for our usecase. Then this query can be for our needs.

Future Improvements:
Continuously evaluate and optimize the LLM's performance and accuracy.
Adding additional database support and making it more user friendly to analyze even more data.
Context switch between databases by providing the schema.

- ABSTRACT: Food Memories at a Glance

*** Description:
What it does

#App Overview
This app uses AI to analyze and save only photos taken at restaurants on a smartphone. It’s designed for food enthusiasts who love visiting cafes and restaurants. Unlike apps like Google Photos, which can mix up search results.
AI filters local photos to save those related to food. The app then uses Gemini to categorize these photos automatically, making it easier to browse and reflect on dining experiences. While categorization is currently server-side, future updates will allow users to customize categories, leveraging Gemini’s image classification capabilities.
Using the Google Place API, the app links photos to specific restaurant locations based on geotagging. This process is typically manual, but here it’s automated with Gemini’s API and Google’s review data, making it easier to track restaurant visits.
#App Architecture
The app classifies photos, saving food-related ones to Firebase Storage. Gemini is implemented as an API to categorize photos. By leveraging the assigned categories, along with the Google Map API and AI-based text analysis, the app automatically links the photos to restaurant data. This allows users to easily preserve memories of the restaurants they visited simply by taking photos.
For more details, please view: (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1bbk4DTR1al9Ttesi4hM3y19ucy1hUj/view?usp=sharing).
For this implementation, we have broadly covered steps 2 to 7. Steps 1 and 8-9 are planned for future implementation.

- TITLE: AI-powered English wordbook  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: The fastest English wordbook for every language speakers

*** Description:
What it does

This app is an AI-powered English wordbook. If you’re an English learner and sometimes encounter unknown words, this app will greatly help with your learning.

The basic features are SEARCHING, CHECKING EXAMPLE SENTENCES, and REVIEWING. You can search for unknown words, check example sentences in your familiar language, and then review the words after some time.

We used the Gemini API for three purposes:

First, for word suggestions. We primarily use the Datamuse API for searching and suggesting words because it is free and fast. However, if you are Japanese and don’t know a word, this app detects Japanese and suggests English words that match the Japanese words via the Gemini API.

Second, for example sentence translations. If you are Korean, you can see translations of example sentences into Korean through the Gemini API. This app supports a wide range of languages.

Lastly, for reviewing your own sentences. After saving words, you can review them by creating your own sentences. This approach is called “Active Learning.” Creating your own sentences makes your language learning more efficient. At this stage, Gemini will review your sentences and provide feedback on their correctness. If a sentence is incorrect, Gemini will suggest how to fix it.

That’s all. Thank you very much.

- TITLE: envGemini  |  Gemini API Developer Competition  |  Google AI for Developers
- ABSTRACT: Empower yourself to combat climate change through our interactive app.

*** Description:
What it does

Our app is an educational tool aiming to teach people about global warming and give them the opportunity to do their bit by being nonconformists. Firstly, during the app startup, one is provided with a very attractive initial page whose link choices are called "Learn More" and "Begin New Life".

The "Learn More" button transports users to an interactive book consisting of topics related to climate change and the essential article and resources that can be found here are useful sources for developing discernment of different environmental issues. This segment will allow users to search the list of topics from the science of climate change to the practices of the sustainability industries in the world.

The "Begin New Life" button kicks off a personalized journey where users talk to a screen powered by the Gemini API. The bot then asks specific questions to the user such as his/her lifestyle and habits, and finally it provides the users with personal feedback on the areas they can primarily work on to cut down on the carbon footprint they create and to be more environmentally conscious in general. Our app utilizes the Gemini API's sophisticated data processing capability to bring forth particularly actionable notions and realistic recommendations based on individual behavior.

Individually, these technology assets develop a strategy that combines the education of the climate crisis and a user’s practice to help them make a big change

- ABSTRACT: AI-powered insights and statistics for advanced gut health tracking

*** Description:
What it does

Poopie is a unique social app already in production, designed to break taboos around discussing digestive health. Many people feel embarrassed about poops, so we created a platform where users can connect socially while gaining health insights. For our current submission, we focus solely on Poopie’s advanced gut health tracking, enhanced with AI analytics through Gemini.

Our app is designed for users seeking deeper insights into their digestive health, it provides comprehensive data logging, personalized insights, and clear statistical analysis.

Users can log detailed information about bowel movements, such as stool composition, volume, color, and conditions. The intuitive interface simplifies tracking, and personal notes about meals or symptoms can be added for context.

For AI analysis, we used the official google_generative_ai package to access the Gemini API, ideal for prototyping. Users can select a date range for analysis, and the app sends their logs within that period to Gemini. The API uses a detailed system instruction, found in the code, to analyze the data. The insights and recommendations returned are displayed on the UI, helping users understand their gut health comprehensively and identify potential issues or improvements.

A key feature is the statistical overview, which presents digestive data in easy-to-read charts. Users can review historical data and trends through a calendar feature, tracking progress over time.

*** Description:
What it does

T.O.M. has three features all designed to help college students throughout their days. The first facet is the Quotes function, which generates motivational and optimistic aphorisms centered around our feline theme. For additional immersion, we used text-to-speech for live readings of the quotes. In order to diversify our phrases, we utilized the Gemini API to develop T.O.M.’s wise words. To continue, our second feature is the Schedule Builder. In this segment, the user inputs their daily activities, the time required for each task and any other relevant notes. Then, using the power of Gemini, T.O.M. presents the user with a completely-personalized schedule, factoring in all of the inputs along with ample time for meals and sleep. For an extra positive note, every schedule ends with a distinct piece of advice that is read to the user through text-to-speech. Finally, the third pillar of our application is Tomodoro. Taking inspiration from the Pomodoro technique, Tomodoro has three timers for study time, short breaks and long breaks. However, the level of customizability integrated into Tomodoro truly sets it apart. All the timer lengths are adjustable to suit your needs. More prominently, the colors of the background, buttons and text on Tomodoro can be altered, both via dropdown selections or by having Gemini generate colors based on a given prompt. In summary, the three facets T.O.M. features all have very simplistic foundations that are elevated through the Gemini API.

- ABSTRACT: Wagabit connects buyers with relevant sellers or services locally.

*** Description:
What it does

Wagabit is a platform that connects buyers with relevant sellers or service providers in their local area. It allows users to submit requests for products or services they are looking for, specifying details and setting a preferred location radius. Sellers and service providers within that radius are notified of the requests and can respond through the Wagabit platform, initiating contact with the buyer. This ensures that buyers receive offers from vendors that are geographically convenient and tailored to their needs, while sellers gain access to a targeted audience actively seeking their products or services.

The Gemini API is utilized within Wagabit to efficiently match buyer requests with potential sellers. Seller profiles, including detailed descriptions of their products and services, are saved in Pinecone, a vector database. When a buyer submits a request, the system first filters the seller data using Pinecone’s vector search, comparing the buyer’s request against the stored seller vectors to find the most relevant matches. This initial filtering narrows down the potential matches based on similarity to the buyer's request. The filtered results are then submitted to the Gemini API for a final, refined match that considers additional criteria such as location and specific preferences. This two-step filtering process ensures highly accurate and relevant connections between buyers and sellers, facilitating prompt and successful transactions.

*** Built with:
In addition to the Gemini API, I used Google Maps API for geolocation services, allowing users to set their preferred location and radius for finding relevant sellers or service providers. The Google Maps API was also instrumental in enabling the visualization of these locations on a map within the application. Additionally, I integrated the Google Translate API to translate user requests and seller descriptions into English, ensuring that the application could process and match requests accurately regardless of the original language used. This combination of APIs enabled a seamless, multilingual, and location-based service experience for users.

- ABSTRACT: Innocent Old Lady: Outsmarting scammers by wasting their time

*** Description:
What it does

Innocent Old Lady is an innovative anti-scam application designed to protect potential victims from fraud by cleverly wasting scammers’ time. Utilizing the power of the Gemini API, our system mimics a real conversation with a scammer through a virtual persona named “Milena.” When a scammer calls, our system seamlessly takes over the call, simulating a conversation that mirrors the typical phases of a scam: Problem, Manipulation, and Extraction. By intelligently analyzing the scammer’s speech using the Gemini API, Milena responds in a way that prolongs the interaction, effectively stalling the scammer. This not only prevents them from targeting others during that time but also increases their operational costs, making the scamming process less profitable.

In its first week of operation, Milena successfully stalled four scammers for a total of 82 minutes, demonstrating the practical impact of the system. The Gemini API’s rapid text-to-speech and natural language processing capabilities ensure that the responses are timely and convincing, making it an ideal solution for real-time scam prevention. Innocent Old Lady represents a new approach to cybersecurity-one that turns the tables on scammers by using their own tactics against them. Our goal is to deploy this technology widely, protecting vulnerable populations both in the Czech Republic and internationally.

Barterville is designed to challenge users to push their creativity and persuasion skills to the limit. The core of the experience revolves around interacting with various AI characters. The goal is to negotiate trades, starting with lower-value items and working to the highest-value trades. Each decision requires careful consideration, strategic thinking, and understanding of the AI characters’ motivations and behavior.

We used the Gemini API to enhance the intelligence and personalities of each AI trader. After randomly picking different features for the trader and their item, the API takes in a set of instructions and parameters to generate a trader. The API allows us to generate different dialogue options and trade scenarios, guaranteeing that each interaction feels fresh. We also used the API call to verify whether the user’s name was appropriate to create a more secure user environment. By integrating Gemini, we’ve created a fluid and immersive environment where players are encouraged to think critically and adapt their approach depending on the AI’s responses.

Our aim for this app was to create a distinct platform for users to sharpen their negotiation skills and bring out their creativity to achieve a common goal. Every word and every path taken is unique and different from the rest. This blend of creativity, strategy, and AI interaction forms the backbone of our app, offering an educational yet entertaining experience for all players. It is just the beginning.

*** Description:
What it does

DIRA AI is an innovative tool designed for architects, builders, and developers to create structures that are in harmony with their environment, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation, especially in the tropics. These are regions that have special building requirements, but often buildings fail to adequately respond to the climate. This leads to high energy consumption in buildings and even has adverse effects on the health of building occupants.
By inputting project location, building type, and desired functionalities, users can leverage AI-powered insights to optimize building designs to their micro climate. Beyond this, architects and builders can access climate data for any location on earth by simply dropping a pin on a map.

DIRA analyzes local climate data points like temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, precipitation and radiation then incorporates researched climatic design principles. It then generates tailored recommendations on building orientation, material selection, passive cooling strategies, and water management systems.
The recommendations are then fed back to Gemini to generate an image prompt which is then fed to an image generation API for users to see how the recommendations can be applied.
Gemini API is the engine that brings everything together and we look forward to continuing fine-tuning our model to provide more useful climatic design knowledge for architects, builders and developers, for a better, healthier future.

It's a conversational search engine, powered by Google Gemini API. More models will also have support in the next few updates. Additionally, it can chat with YouTube videos, simply by giving the YouTube URL and chat with any PDF by uploading the PDF. Software is built purely with Python. To use the software, users need to enter their Google Gemini API key (user is prompt to enter the API key), and the software runs flawlessly.
