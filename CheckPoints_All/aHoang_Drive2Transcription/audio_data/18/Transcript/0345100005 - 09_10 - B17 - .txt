[00:00:01] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:00:01] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:02] Speaker 2: And all right. 
[00:00:02] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:00:03] Speaker 2: So, and I think that maybe today we have a quite challenging lesson as well. 
[00:00:07] Speaker 2: Do you think so? 
[00:00:11] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:11] Speaker 2: So when you learn this lesson, how do you feel? 
[00:00:23] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:24] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:00:24] Speaker 2: So it is normal. 
[00:00:24] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:00:27] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:00:28] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:28] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:00:28] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:37] Speaker 2: Oh, okay. 
[00:00:39] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:00:40] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:40] Speaker 2: So it means that in reality, okay, so in your workplace, you also have to handle the problems of others, right? 
[00:00:49] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:00:49] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. 
[00:00:50] Speaker 2: So I think that you must be very tired and you must be very busy as well because you have to do your own responsibilities and then you have to take responsibility for others as well. 
[00:01:02] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:03] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:01:03] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:01:04] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:01:13] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:01:14] Speaker 1: Sorry. 
[00:01:17] Speaker 2: I mean that. 
[00:01:17] Speaker 2: I mean that because you are the manager. 
[00:01:20] Speaker 2: So you will have to take responsibility not only for yourself, but also for others. 
[00:01:24] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:01:25] Speaker 2: Right. 
[00:01:25] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:01:26] Speaker 2: So when you are, you know, in a higher position, so you have a lot of things to do and a lot of things to think about. 
[00:01:33] Speaker 2: Right. 
[00:01:34] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:01:34] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:35] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:01:35] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:35] Speaker 2: But I really appreciate and I really admire, you know, your, how to say, your abilities because you are a girl, you are a woman and you are so thin as well. 
[00:01:48] Speaker 2: You are very thin. 
[00:01:49] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:50] Speaker 2: But yeah, but you are very talented because right now you are the manager. 
[00:01:50] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:01:54] Speaker 2: So I think that you work very hard and you are very serious with your work as well. 
[00:02:00] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:00] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:02:01] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:02] Speaker 2: All right. 
[00:02:05] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:06] Speaker 2: So we will have two main parts. 
[00:02:08] Speaker 2: We will expand ideas together. 
[00:02:11] Speaker 2: And then if we still have time, we have the conversation. 
[00:02:14] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:15] Speaker 2: And here we have six questions together. 
[00:02:19] Speaker 2: But okay, in my opinion, we just only need to answer five questions because actually question number six. 
[00:02:26] Speaker 2: It is the way that you will expand the ideas for question number five, right? 
[00:02:33] Speaker 1: Yeah, sorry. 
[00:02:37] Speaker 1: My micro has some problem. 
[00:02:40] Speaker 1: So can you repeat this slide? 
[00:02:43] Speaker 2: Okay, yes, so can you hear me better? 
[00:02:46] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:02:47] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:02:48] Speaker 2: So I mean that here we have the list of the questions. 
[00:02:51] Speaker 2: Actually, we have six questions, right? 
[00:02:54] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:02:55] Speaker 2: Yes, but in reality, when we tackle each of them, you will find out that, okay, question number six will be combined into question number five. 
[00:03:04] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:03:04] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, because you will explain the reason why you do that action, okay, in question five, okay, by answering why, right? 
[00:03:09] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:03:14] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:03:15] Speaker 2: Yes, okay, so question number one, have you ever had to handle a situation that was not within your responsibility? 
[00:03:24] Speaker 1: Yes, definitely I had to handle a situation That was not within my responsibility because at that time my leader is absent and yes, I need to handle some urgent feedback from the customer. 
[00:03:53] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:03:53] Speaker 2: Okay, some urgent feedback from customers. 
[00:03:58] Speaker 2: Okay, got it? 
[00:03:59] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:04:00] Speaker 2: Okay, so here, I think that your idea is very nice and very logical, okay? 
[00:04:00] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:04] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:05] Speaker 2: And easy to understand as well. 
[00:04:07] Speaker 2: The only thing that you need to pay attention to is the grammar, okay? 
[00:04:10] Speaker 2: Because here, everything happened in the past, right? 
[00:04:14] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:14] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:04:15] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:04:15] Speaker 2: So my letter was absent and I need it, right? 
[00:04:17] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:19] Speaker 2: Yeah, I need it. 
[00:04:20] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:04:20] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:20] Speaker 2: So just try to remember the tense of the verb, okay? 
[00:04:24] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:25] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:04:26] Speaker 2: Now, what kind of situation did you handle? 
[00:04:32] Speaker 1: As I mentioned before, I needed to handle the feedback, the urgent feedback from the customer. 
[00:04:34] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:04:48] Speaker 2: from customers okay and so how can you expand more How can you spend more? 
[00:04:49] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:05:04] Speaker 2: Like, all right, so you have to handle the urgent feedback from customers, right? 
[00:05:07] Speaker 1: And This task was out of my ability. 
[00:05:08] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:05:09] Speaker 2: And you can tell me that, all right, was that difficult for you to do that or was that easy for you? 
[00:05:16] Speaker 2: And what you had to do, okay, what you had to do to handle? 
[00:05:26] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:05:32] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:05:33] Speaker 2: Okay, my ability?

[00:06:00] Speaker 2: Okay, so it means that you, yeah, it means that you come to the office of your manager, for example, and then they wanted him to support you. 
[00:06:01] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:09] Speaker 2: Okay, I asked for.

[00:06:16] Speaker 1: My manager, yes. 
[00:06:18] Speaker 2: Okay, so when we talk about line manager, it is like the person who directly, okay, supervise you, right?

[00:06:25] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:06:26] Speaker 1: Yes.

[00:06:30] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:32] Speaker 2: Alright, so this task was out of my ability to solve or out of my control as well. 
[00:06:38] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:06:39] Speaker 2: Yes, nó vượt quá tầm kiểm soát của mình ấy, đúng không ạ? 
[00:06:42] Speaker 1: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah. 
[00:06:43] Speaker 2: Vậy nên là tôi lại phải xin cái sự trợ giúp từ cái người quản lý ngay trên tôi, được không ạ? 
[00:06:48] Speaker 2: Ok, chính xác. 
[00:06:48] Speaker 2: Em thấy ở đây ý tưởng của mình khá là tốt và mình cũng đã nắm được cái cách mình nối ý rồi ấy. 
[00:06:53] Speaker 2: Tức là câu trên mình có, mình có nhắc qua cái này. 
[00:06:55] Speaker 2: Thế nhưng mà rõ ràng là cái đấy nó chỉ là một cái ý rất là nhỏ thôi. 
[00:06:59] Speaker 2: Còn đây, bây giờ cái câu số 2 này người ta mới hỏi là cái câu chính của nó là cái này. 
[00:07:03] Speaker 2: Được không ạ? 
[00:07:04] Speaker 2: Vậy thì Pete sẽ phải đi sâu và xem là ok, cái urgent feedback của customer đấy, cái vấn đề đấy nó cụ thể nó như thế nào. 
[00:07:10] Speaker 2: Được không ạ? 
[00:07:11] Speaker 2: Hay là cái độ nghiêm trọng của nó ra làm sao thì đấy chính là cái phần mà đằng sau chị đang nói đấy. 
[00:07:14] Speaker 2: Được không ạ? 
[00:07:15] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:07:16] Speaker 2: Rồi chứ còn cái phần câu số 1 mình mới chỉ đang nói cái bề nổi của nó thôi. 
[00:07:19] Speaker 2: Chứ còn cái tầng sâu hơn thì mình chưa nói. 
[00:07:20] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:07:22] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:07:22] Speaker 2: Vậy nên là em vẫn hỏi câu số 2 bình thường ha. 
[00:07:25] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:07:25] Speaker 2: Okay, yes. 
[00:07:26] Speaker 2: So now I want you to repeat question number 2 again so that you will fix the tense of the verb.

[00:10:01] Speaker 2: Yes, okay.

[00:11:59] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:12:05] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:12:09] Speaker 2: Okay, you know the word work, right?

[00:12:23] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:12:24] Speaker 2: Or it worked. 
[00:12:25] Speaker 2: Yeah, it means like, okay, so when we use this phrase, we want to talk about like whether or not it was or it is effective or not. 
[00:12:33] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:12:35] Speaker 2: Okay, okay. 
[00:12:36] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:12:36] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:12:37] Speaker 2: So here, if you want to extend your idea a little bit or you want your sentence a little bit longer, so you can tell me that at first. 
[00:12:40] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:12:44] Speaker 2: So I try to... Okay. 
[00:12:47] Speaker 2: So here we use the word handle so many times, so I do not want to use this anymore. 
[00:12:50] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:12:52] Speaker 2: So can you give me some synonymous words for this? 
[00:12:57] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:13:02] Speaker 2: Yeah, we will have tackle. 
[00:13:04] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:13:04] Speaker 1: Tackle. 
[00:13:05] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:13:05] Speaker 2: Okay.

[00:13:15] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:13:15] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:13:15] Speaker 2: So you can use all the words. 
[00:13:17] Speaker 2: All right. 
[00:13:17] Speaker 2: Paraphrase a little bit. 
[00:13:19] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:13:20] Speaker 2: I try to tackle. 
[00:13:24] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:13:24] Speaker 2: Okay, I tried to tackle by myself, right? 
[00:13:27] Speaker 2: By myself. 
[00:13:28] Speaker 2: It means that you would do it alone, right? 
[00:13:42] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah. 
[00:13:44] Speaker 2: So, therefore... Okay, I had, okay, or I had no choice. 
[00:13:53] Speaker 2: Okay, but, yeah, but, okay, ask for, right? 
[00:13:58] Speaker 2: Yes, ask for. 
[00:14:02] Speaker 2: But if you use the word receive, so maybe I will not know whether or not you ask for the help or maybe your line manager. 
[00:14:02] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:14:10] Speaker 2: actually knew that problem and then willing to help you. 
[00:14:12] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:14:13] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:14:14] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:14:14] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:14:15] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:14:15] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:14:16] Speaker 2: So if you use the phrase ask for, so I will understand that.

[00:22:21] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:22:32] Speaker 1: Yes, definitely. 
[00:22:33] Speaker 1: I had to handle a situation or not within my responsibility because at that time my leader was absent and I need to handle the urgent feedback from the customers. 
[00:22:52] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:22:52] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:22:53] Speaker 2: So it means that because of the unexpected absence of your manager, so you had to handle his responsibilities, right? 
[00:22:59] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:23:02] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:23:03] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:23:03] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:23:04] Speaker 2: So how did you feel at that time? 
[00:23:27] Speaker 2: Okay, yes. 
[00:23:28] Speaker 2: So did you handle this situation by yourself or you get the assistance from someone? 
[00:23:36] Speaker 1: At first, I tackled it by myself. 
[00:23:40] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. 
[00:23:52] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. 
[00:23:53] Speaker 1: I have no choice. 
[00:23:54] Speaker 1: And I asked my manager to help me to make the decision.

[00:24:40] Speaker 2: So it was a little bit out of your control, right? 
[00:24:44] Speaker 2: Yes, okay, so now... Like if you had a chance, another chance, so did you do something differently? 
[00:24:57] Speaker 1: I think if I had a change, I would not change anything because my managers were absent. 
[00:25:00] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. 
[00:25:08] Speaker 1: unexpectedly and I think I need to handle this task but I believe I can learn the useful lessons from these situations yeah yeah Yeah.

[00:25:23] Speaker 2: Mm-hmm. 
[00:25:24] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, I agree as well because, you know, actually the reason was quite objective, right? 
[00:25:31] Speaker 2: It was not, yeah, it was not your subjective reason, okay? 
[00:25:38] Speaker 2: It came from your manager. 
[00:25:40] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:25:42] Speaker 2: The only thing that you need, you could do at that time was try your best, okay, to find out the, you know, how to say the most pragmatic solution, okay? 
[00:25:52] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:25:52] Speaker 2: Okay.

[00:26:58] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:26:59] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:27:00] Speaker 2: Okay, rồi nhìn chung là bài này thì em nghĩ là mình sẽ không có quá nhiều vấn đề về mặt content đâu, bởi vì nó rất là clear rồi, được không ạ? 
[00:27:05] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:27:06] Speaker 2: Và em cũng thấy là, chị cũng nói là bài này thì mình cũng đã có cái sự trải nghiệm thực tế rồi, thế nên là em thấy các cái câu trả lời của mình nó rất là logical. 
[00:27:06] Speaker 1: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah. 
[00:27:14] Speaker 2: Đúng là kiểu như là có thử rồi Có trải rồi nên mình cảm thấy là Mọi thứ nó sẽ dễ tưởng tượng và dễ hình dung hơn Đúng không ạ Tuy nhiên ở chỗ này mình lưu ý một chút này Mình có một cái phần nhầm lẫn giữa Câu chủ động và câu bị động Cái mà I could be done I could be done tức là tôi xong đời rồi đấy chị ạ Yes, okay. 
[00:27:34] Speaker 2: Tức là kiểu cái này là tôi bị làm xong rồi. 
[00:27:36] Speaker 2: Tức là kiểu ai đấy là đã như thế này rồi ạ. Yeah, yeah. 
[00:27:40] Speaker 2: Okay, yes. 
[00:27:41] Speaker 2: Nói chung là nó không ổn lắm rồi. 
[00:27:44] Speaker 2: Vậy thì chút này sẽ là I could finish hoặc là I could solve the problem thôi được không ạ? 
[00:27:44] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:27:49] Speaker 2: Tại vì đằng sau thì chỉ có từ problem thì nên dùng từ solve hoặc I could tackle address hoặc gì đấy. 
[00:27:49] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:27:51] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:27:54] Speaker 2: Được không ạ? 
[00:27:54] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:27:54] Speaker 2: Đó, bởi vì mình nhớ cho em nhé là cái câu trúc về dạng câu bị động nó sẽ là dạng B cộng với lại vớt phân từ 2 thì đây sẽ là dạng câu trúc câu bị động. 
[00:28:03] Speaker 2: Thế nên nếu mà I quit be done thì là done thật đấy chị nhé Ok, yes, ok Phần thứ 2 thì đây là câu chúc Câu bị động Một xíu xíu lưu ý cho em Những cái từ này thì mặc dù nó là 2 chữ S đi gần nhau Thế nhưng mà nó chỉ là lesson, sở nhẹ thôi Yeah, lesson Yes, con từ này thì sẽ là decision Lúc này sẽ phải chu miệng lên Đúng rồi, chính xác. 
[00:28:16] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:28:20] Speaker 1: Listen. 
[00:28:25] Speaker 1: Yeah, decision.

[00:29:29] Speaker 2: Hoặc là ra làm sao Bắt đầu khi nó đến đứt là mình cũng phải xác định luôn là Ok, mình sẽ chia thị quá khứ Chứ mình không thể nào để mình nghe hết cả câu này Xong sau đấy mình mới xác định là À ok, lúc này mình cần chia thị quá khứ Thế thì nó không kịp mất rồi Được không ạ? 
[00:29:42] Speaker 2: Yeah, ok, lúc đấy là mình vừa cần phải trả lời Mà mình vừa phải giải quyết luôn vấn đề chia thị Thì chắc chắn là mình sẽ nhầm thôi Okay.
