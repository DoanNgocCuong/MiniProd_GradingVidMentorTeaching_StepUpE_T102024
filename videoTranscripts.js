        transcript: `[00:00:00] Speaker 1: Okay, so the day before, we solved that problem together. 
        [00:00:07] Speaker 1: We... Alright, how do I say? 
        [00:00:10] Speaker 1: We expanded ideas for the Vietnam Food Contest, right? 
        [00:00:15] Speaker 1: Yes, okay. 
        [00:00:16] Speaker 1: So after that day, when I got home, I had time to online or when I was preparing a new song. 
        [00:00:41] Speaker 1: Or do you know how to prepare it? 
        [00:00:44] Speaker 1: I still have to answer. 
        [00:00:46] Speaker 1: But when you read a question, you need to think a little bit further. 
        [00:00:52] Speaker 1: Like, okay, how do I need to explain the answer? 
        [00:00:55] Speaker 1: Is that okay? 
        [00:01:04] Speaker 1: For A1, the requirement will be lower, so it will only go that far. 
        [00:01:12] Speaker 1: We still need more content later. 
        [00:01:24] Speaker 1: Okay, for this sentence, after I answer like this, what should I answer next? 
        [00:01:29] Speaker 1: Something like that, okay? 
        [00:01:30] Speaker 1: And in front of your eyes, I will only ask you to give me one more answer. 
        [00:01:37] Speaker 1: That is, your total answer will be two small sentences, okay? 
        [00:01:48] Speaker 1: Okay, so as a local from Hanoi, you are meeting your foreign friend who is visiting Vietnam for the very first time. 
        [00:02:02] Speaker 1: Okay, and I will ask you about Vietnamese cuisine. 
        [00:02:05] Speaker 1: You got it? 
        [00:02:07] Speaker 1: Yes, okay, so are you ready for the conversation together? 
        [00:02:16] Speaker 1: Okay, so why are you smiling? 
        [00:02:26] Speaker 1: Okay, so bây giờ cái chị cần nói là mình sẽ có phần conversation và chị sẽ dựa vào những câu hỏi ở trên đây nhé. 
        [00:03:28] Speaker 1: Yes, okay, so how much does this cost? 
        [00:03:41] Speaker 1: Okay, 50 or 15? 
        [00:03:44] Speaker 2: Fifty. 
        [00:03:45] Speaker 1: Okay, 50. 
        [00:03:46] Speaker 2: Under 50. 
        [00:03:46] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:03:47] Speaker 1: Yes. 
        [00:03:47] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:03:48] Speaker 1: So do you think that the price is different when you buy in different places? 
        [00:04:04] Speaker 1: Okay, so you said that the price is often under 50,000 VND, right? 
        [00:04:12] Speaker 1: So now I want to know, if you have that kind of dish in the restaurant, is the price higher or more expensive than when you have it in a roadside eatery? 
        [00:04:40] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so the price will be more expensive than in a rosary, right? 
        [00:04:45] Speaker 1: Yes. 
        [00:04:54] Speaker 2: I think a restaurant is the best place to get that because They cook is very delicious and they have many vegetables to eat with. 
        [00:05:47] Speaker 1: Yes, Vietnamese salad. 
        [00:05:48] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
        [00:05:50] Speaker 1: Yes, okay, yeah, so you mean that we will eat sticky rice, okay, with salad, Vietnamese salad? 
        [00:05:57] Speaker 1: Oh, really? 
        [00:06:08] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:06:11] Speaker 2: Okay. 
        [00:06:47] Speaker 1: Do you think that the space when you eat street food is much more comfortable than when you eat in a restaurant? 
        [00:07:01] Speaker 1: Okay, do you think the space when you eat street food is much more comfortable when you eat in a restaurant? 
        [00:07:11] Speaker 1: Yes, right? 
        [00:07:12] Speaker 1: Because, you know, the space is open and then you and your friends and, okay, your friend and you can talk and can laugh, okay, yeah, without being criticized by others. 
        [00:07:14] Speaker 2: Yes. 
        [00:07:16] Speaker 2: Yes, open. 
        [00:07:18] Speaker 2: Yes. 
        [00:07:26] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
        [00:07:31] Speaker 2: I like Shrewsbury because I like the open space and just low price and I can talk with my friend and talk and laugh with my friend. 
        [00:07:37] Speaker 1: Again. 
        [00:07:40] Speaker 1: Maybe the low price, right? 
        [00:07:45] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:07:55] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:07:56] Speaker 1: All right. 
        [00:07:57] Speaker 1: So can you tell me what is your favorite street fruit? 
        [00:08:03] Speaker 1: What is your favorite street fruit? 
        [00:08:09] Speaker 2: I really love eating sausage. 
        [00:08:13] Speaker 1: Uh-huh. 
        [00:08:16] Speaker 1: Okay, sausage. 
        [00:08:19] Speaker 1: And? 
        [00:08:21] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, just sausage. 
        [00:08:22] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, but you can tell me why. 
        [00:08:24] Speaker 1: Why do you like sausage? 
        [00:08:30] Speaker 2: Because it is sausage and many things fried. 
        [00:08:41] Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, so I think that you like fried snacks, right? 
        [00:08:45] Speaker 1: Okay, maybe fried fish balls or something else. 
        [00:08:50] Speaker 1: Okay, fried snacks. 
        [00:08:53] Speaker 1: Yes, okay. 
        [00:08:55] Speaker 1: Okay, such as, okay, such as, okay, fried, okay, sausages, or maybe fried fish balls. 
        [00:09:05] Speaker 1: Is that right? 
        [00:09:08] Speaker 2: Fishbowl. 
        [00:09:09] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:09:10] Speaker 1: Yes. 
        [00:09:12] Speaker 1: OK. 
        [00:09:13] Speaker 1: OK. 
        [00:09:14] Speaker 2: Fishbowl. 
        [00:09:15] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
        [00:09:17] Speaker 1: OK. 
        [00:09:17] Speaker 1: You got it right. 
        [00:09:20] Speaker 1: Yes. 
        [00:09:20] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
        [00:09:20] Speaker 1: OK. 
        [00:09:21] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
        [00:09:21] Speaker 1: So I think that maybe first of all, because all of these dishes are very delicious. 
        [00:09:28] Speaker 1: Right. 
        [00:09:29] Speaker 1: And they are quite cheap as well. 
        [00:09:31] Speaker 1: So you can eat a lot without spending too much money. 
        [00:09:35] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
        [00:09:37] Speaker 1: And, you know, these kinds of dishes are loved by Vietnamese teenagers as well. 
        [00:09:43] Speaker 1: Okay, not only you, but other young people, they all like this. 
        [00:09:47] Speaker 1: Okay, yes, okay, understand. 
        [00:09:49] Speaker 1: Okay, so thank you so much. 
        [00:09:51] Speaker 1: We have a conversation about this topic. 
        [00:09:53] Speaker 1: Okay, yes, and now I would like to give you the feedback. 
        [00:09:56] Speaker 1: Okay, so đây cũng là lần đầu tiên mà chị em mình chuyển sang là mình sau khi mình expand idea xong thì mình đập vai và mình... I see that all of your questions, Kim Anh understands and answers them on the content side. 
        [00:10:25] Speaker 1: There are some sentences that you can reflect quite quickly, but there are some sentences that you are reflecting a bit slowly. 
        [00:10:34] Speaker 1: Or there are some sentences that you see that you are still There are some sentences that I will not follow the correct order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 here. 
        [00:10:40] Speaker 1: No. 
        [00:10:40] Speaker 1: If you do that, firstly, you will get your homework done. 
        [00:10:43] Speaker 1: Secondly, there will be no more surprises. 
        [00:10:45] Speaker 1: It will no longer be related to you listening to your question to answer. 
        [00:10:49] Speaker 1: But you already know the question, right? 
        [00:10:54] Speaker 1: So there will be some sentences, the meaning of the question is still the same, but you change from the beginning to ask. 
        [00:11:00] Speaker 1: Or you add 1 or 2 smaller questions below. 
        [00:11:04] Speaker 1: After that, you will ask another question on the app, right? 
        [00:11:08] Speaker 1: So there will be some sentences that you ask, do you feel that if you eat this dish at the restaurant, it will be more expensive to eat at the restaurant or not? 
        [00:11:21] Speaker 1: See? 
        [00:11:27] Speaker 1: Right? 
        [00:11:28] Speaker 1: So the sentence you added is not too complicated or too far-fetched. 
        [00:11:33] Speaker 1: What you need here is that you want to check your listening ability. 
        [00:11:37] Speaker 1: And when you understand it, how will you solve that problem? 
        [00:11:41] Speaker 1: Is that okay? 
        [00:11:44] Speaker 1: You just need me to give you the answer why. 
        [00:11:49] Speaker 1: And the idea why is also slightly simple, emotional. 
        [00:11:52] Speaker 1: Is that okay? 
        [00:11:52] Speaker 1: Yes, but I think Kim Anh needs to practice more. 
        [00:12:00] Speaker 1: Or there are some sentences that I think are as good as the last sentence. 
        [00:12:04] Speaker 1: I asked what your favorite food is. 
        [00:12:06] Speaker 1: Actually, my question is just what is toy. 
        [00:12:09] Speaker 1: So you can only answer one question. 
        [00:12:19] Speaker 1: The important thing is what is the next step of that dish. 
        [00:12:25] Speaker 1: Now you said you like fried food, you like fried fish, you like sausage, sausage, sausage, right? 
        [00:12:31] Speaker 1: So now the question I want to ask is why do you like to eat that dish, but not like to eat mixed rice paper, not like to drink tea, tea, not like to eat tea, etc. 
        [00:12:41] Speaker 1: No. 
        [00:12:42] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:12:43] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:12:44] Speaker 1: Phát triển ý tưởng là mình sẽ phải đi sâu vào một cái gì đấy cơ mà. 
        [00:12:48] Speaker 1: Đúng không ạ? 
        [00:12:49] Speaker 1: Đấy. 
        [00:12:49] Speaker 1: Thì nhớ cho chị nắp mỗi hôm trước thì chị còn nói ở đây này. 
        [00:12:52] Speaker 1: Đó. 
        [00:12:53] Speaker 1: Một câu trả lời của mình sẽ có từ 2 đến 3 câu nhỏ hơn. 
        [00:12:55] Speaker 1: Đúng không ạ? 
        [00:12:56] Speaker 1: Trong đó câu số 1 hỏi gì trả lời đó. 
        [00:12:58] Speaker 1: Câu số 2 thì thường sẽ expand theo hướng trả lời là why. 
        [00:13:01] Speaker 1: Hoặc nếu mà cảm thấy trả lời why không hợp lý thì em sẽ trả lời cho các câu hỏi khác như là what, where, when, who, how. 
        [00:13:07] Speaker 1: Được không ạ? 
        [00:13:08] Speaker 1: Đấy thì mình cứ bám sát vào cái cấu trúc này của chị là được nha. 
        [00:13:11] Speaker 1: Được không ạ? 
        [00:13:12] Speaker 1: Yes, rồi trong cái quá trình mà Kim Anh trả lời cho chị thì mình có đề cập đến món là sticky rice đúng không? 
        [00:13:20] Speaker 1: Vậy thì sticky rice theo Kim Anh hiểu thì nó là món gì ạ? 
        [00:13:25] Speaker 2: So yeah. 
        [00:13:33] Speaker 1: The best place to get that is a restaurant. 
        [00:13:38] Speaker 1: Okay. 
        [00:13:40] Speaker 1: Được không ạ? 
        [00:13:41] Speaker 1: Tức là bây giờ em không quay được nữa thì em đi theo where đi. 
        [00:13:47] Speaker 1: À, em hãy cho chị biết cái quán ruột, cái nhà hàng ruột mà em hay ăn xôi ở đấy và em cảm th…`,
