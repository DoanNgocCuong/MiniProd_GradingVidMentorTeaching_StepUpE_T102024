[00:00:01] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:00:01] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:02] Speaker 2: And all right. 
[00:00:02] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:00:03] Speaker 2: So, and I think that maybe today we have a quite challenging lesson as well. 
[00:00:07] Speaker 2: Do you think so? 
[00:00:10] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:00:11] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:11] Speaker 2: So when you learn this lesson, how do you feel? 
[00:00:23] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:24] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:00:24] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:00:26] Speaker 1: Yes, yes, because I feel like it is similar in my life, yes, my work. 
[00:00:27] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:00:28] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:28] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:00:28] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:37] Speaker 2: Oh, okay. 
[00:00:39] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:00:40] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:00:40] Speaker 2: So it means that in reality, okay, so in your workplace, you also have to handle the problems of others, right? 
[00:00:49] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:00:49] Speaker 2: Oh, yeah. 
[00:00:50] Speaker 2: So I think that you must be very tired and you must be very busy as well because you have to do your own responsibilities and then you have to take responsibility for others as well. 
[00:01:02] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:03] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:01:03] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:01:04] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:01:13] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:01:14] Speaker 1: Sorry. 
[00:01:17] Speaker 2: I mean that. 
[00:01:17] Speaker 2: I mean that. 
[00:01:19] Speaker 2: Because you are the manager, so you will have to take responsibility not only for yourself, but also for others, right? 
[00:01:24] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:01:25] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:01:26] Speaker 2: So when you are, you know, in a higher position, so you have a lot of things to do and a lot of things to think about, right? 
[00:01:34] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:01:34] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:35] Speaker 2: OK. 
[00:01:35] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:35] Speaker 2: But I really appreciate and I really admire, you know, your how I say your abilities, because you are a girl, you are a woman and you are so thin as well. 
[00:01:48] Speaker 2: You are very thin. 
[00:01:49] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:01:50] Speaker 2: But yeah, but you are very talented because right now you are the manager. 
[00:01:50] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:01:54] Speaker 2: So I think that you work very hard and you are very serious with your work as well. 
[00:02:00] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:00] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:02:01] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:02] Speaker 2: All right. 
[00:02:05] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:06] Speaker 2: So we will have two main parts. 
[00:02:08] Speaker 2: We will expand ideas together. 
[00:02:11] Speaker 2: And then if we still have time, we have the conversation. 
[00:02:14] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:02:15] Speaker 2: And here we have six questions together. 
[00:02:19] Speaker 2: But okay, in my opinion, we just only need to answer five questions because actually question number six. 
[00:02:26] Speaker 2: It is the way that you will expand the ideas for question number five. 
[00:02:33] Speaker 2: Right? 
[00:02:33] Speaker 1: Yeah, sorry. 
[00:02:35] Speaker 1: My, my, my micro has some problem. 
[00:02:40] Speaker 1: So can you repeat is like Yes. 
[00:02:43] Speaker 2: Okay, yes, you can hear me better? 
[00:02:47] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:02:48] Speaker 2: So I mean that here we have the list of the question. 
[00:02:51] Speaker 2: Actually, we have six questions, right? 
[00:02:54] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:02:55] Speaker 2: Yes, but in reality, when we tackle each of them, you will find out that, okay, question number six will be combined into question number five. 
[00:03:04] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:03:04] Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, because you will explain the reason why you do that action, okay, in question five, okay, by answering why, right? 
[00:03:09] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:03:14] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:03:15] Speaker 2: Yes, okay, so question number one, have you ever had to handle a situation that was not within your responsibility? 
[00:03:24] Speaker 1: Yes, definitely. 
[00:03:26] Speaker 1: I had handle a situation But that was not within my responsibility because at that time, my leader is absent and I need to handle some urgent feedback from the customer. 
[00:03:53] Speaker 2: Okay, some urgent feedback from customers. 
[00:03:58] Speaker 2: Okay, got it? 
[00:03:59] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:04:00] Speaker 2: Okay, so here, I think that your idea is very nice and very logical, okay? 
[00:04:00] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:04] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:05] Speaker 2: And easy to understand as well. 
[00:04:07] Speaker 2: The only thing that you need to pay attention to is the grammar, okay? 
[00:04:10] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:10] Speaker 2: Because here, everything happened in the past, right? 
[00:04:14] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:14] Speaker 2: Yes, okay, so my litter was absent, and I need it, right? 
[00:04:17] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:04:19] Speaker 2: Yeah, I need it. 
[00:04:20] Speaker 2: Yes, okay, so just try to remember the tense of the verb, okay? 
[00:04:20] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:24] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:25] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:04:26] Speaker 2: Now, what kind of situation did you handle? 
[00:04:31] Speaker 1: I handle, as I mentioned before, I needed to handle the feedback, the urgent feedback from the customer. 
[00:04:34] Speaker 2: Yeah. 
[00:04:48] Speaker 2: from customers. 
[00:04:49] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:04:49] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:04:55] Speaker 2: And so how can you expand more? 
[00:04:57] Speaker 1: And Yeah. 
[00:05:03] Speaker 2: How can you spend more? 
[00:05:04] Speaker 2: Like, all right, so you have to handle the urgent feedback from customers, right? 
[00:05:08] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:05:09] Speaker 2: And you can tell me that, all right. 
[00:05:12] Speaker 2: Was that difficult for you to do that? 
[00:05:14] Speaker 2: Or was that easy for you? 
[00:05:16] Speaker 2: And what you had to do, okay? 
[00:05:18] Speaker 2: What you had to do to handle? 
[00:05:23] Speaker 1: This task was out of my ability. 
[00:05:26] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:05:32] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:05:32] Speaker 2: ah okay my ability okay to solve right okay yes all right so do you did you you know get the the help from anybody okay okay yeah i got the help yeah or the assistant right you know the word assistant Okay, or maybe here you can tell me like, I asked for. 
[00:05:36] Speaker 1: To, yes, to solve. 
[00:05:42] Speaker 1: And, yes, and I guess the help from my manager, my direct manager, yeah, I got, yeah. 
[00:05:56] Speaker 1: Yeah, yes. 
[00:06:00] Speaker 2: Okay, so it means that you, yeah, it means that you come to the office of your manager, for example, and then they wanted him to support you. 
[00:06:09] Speaker 2: Okay, I asked for. 
[00:06:09] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:10] Speaker 2: Yes, okay. 
[00:06:12] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:13] Speaker 2: Okay, from my line, I would say, yeah, my line manager. 
[00:06:16] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:17] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:06:17] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:18] Speaker 2: Okay, so when we talk about line manager, it is like the person who directly, okay, supervise you, right? 
[00:06:23] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:26] Speaker 2: Yeah, or we can say our supervisor, my supervisor. 
[00:06:29] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:06:30] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:06:32] Speaker 2: Alright, so this task was out of my ability to solve or out of my control as well. 
[00:06:38] Speaker 2: Okay. 
[00:06:39] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:06:39] Speaker 2: Okay, correct. 
[00:06:40] Speaker 2: I think my idea is quite good and I have understood how you mean it. 
[00:06:42] Speaker 1: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Yeah. 
[00:06:46] Speaker 2: That is, the above sentence, I have mentioned this. 
[00:06:52] Speaker 2: But clearly, that is just a very small meaning. 
[00:06:58] Speaker 2: And now, the second sentence, people have just asked that the main sentence of it is this. 
[00:07:04] Speaker 2: Okay? 
[00:07:05] Speaker 2: So I will have to go deeper and see the urgent feedback of that customer, how specific that problem is. 
[00:07:14] Speaker 2: Okay? 
[00:07:16] Speaker 2: Or how serious it is. 
[00:07:19] Speaker 2: That is the part that you are talking about. 
[00:07:20] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:07:23] Speaker 2: Okay? 
[00:07:24] Speaker 2: Yes, okay, so now I want you to repeat question number two again so that you will fix the tense of the verb. 
[00:07:25] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:07:31] Speaker 2: Okay, remember this one. 
[00:07:33] Speaker 2: Okay, yes, so what kind of situation did you handle?

[00:07:38] Speaker 1: As I mentioned before, I had to handle the urgent feedbacks from customers. 
[00:07:45] Speaker 1: And these tasks were out of my ability to solve. 
[00:07:49] Speaker 1: And I asked for the help from my life manager. 
[00:07:53] Speaker 2: Okay, yes, remember here was. 
[00:07:56] Speaker 1: Words, yeah. 
[00:07:58] Speaker 2: Yes, all right.

[00:08:03] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:08:06] Speaker 2: Okay, question number three. 
[00:08:08] Speaker 2: So how did you feel? 
[00:08:10] Speaker 2: Okay, so when you listen to my question, so please decide the tense that you are going to use in your answer.

[00:12:24] Speaker 2: Or it worked. 
[00:12:25] Speaker 2: Yeah, it means like, okay, so when we use this phrase, we want to talk about like whether or not it was or it is effective or not.

[00:12:36] Speaker 2: Yes. 
[00:12:36] Speaker 2: Okay.

[00:14:42] Speaker 2: So how did you handle that situation? 
[00:14:45] Speaker 1: Yes. 
[00:14:46] Speaker 1: At first, I tried to tackle by myself. 
[00:14:52] Speaker 1: Therefore, I had no choice but ask for the support from my life manager and to make the decision in this situation. 
[00:15:03] Speaker 2: Hmm. 
[00:15:03] Speaker 1: And thanks to his help, I could finish the problem on time.

[00:15:30] Speaker 2: Now, question number five. 
[00:15:31] Speaker 2: So if you had a chance, so what would you do differently? 
[00:15:35] Speaker 1: Oh, if I had a chance, I would not change anything because I believe that I will learn the experience and knowledge every time like this. 
[00:16:00] Speaker 2: okay yes all right so okay or maybe you can tell me that we can draw okay some useful lessons right okay from okay these situations right Yes, okay, or maybe you can tell me, okay, so I would not change anything because actually you cannot change the schedule of your boss or your manager, right?

[00:28:49] Speaker 1: Yeah, I do. 
[00:28:53] Speaker 2: It will always have to be at least two questions and there will be a development of intention. 
[00:28:54] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:28:58] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:28:59] Speaker 2: Two questions are already the minimum because it will include one question I answer to the question and one question I develop intention.

[00:29:02] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:29:08] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:29:09] Speaker 1: Yeah.

[00:29:12] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:29:13] Speaker 2: Today, you will see that when people talk about the question, when you start asking me, you will need to determine that each word you ask is used for what purpose. 
[00:29:23] Speaker 2: For example, in this place, when you say how, you will have to determine that okay, now you are asking about how or maybe emotions. 
[00:29:34] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:29:42] Speaker 1: Yeah. 
[00:29:48] Speaker 1: Yeah.
